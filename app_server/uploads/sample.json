		"Description": "[AWS Health may periodically trigger reminder notifications about this communication.]\n\nYou are receiving this message because your AWS Account has one or more Amazon RDS, or Amazon Aurora database instances in the EU-WEST-1 Region using a SSL/TLS Certificate that is expiring on August 22, 2024.  \n\nA list of your affected resources can be found in the 'Affected resources' tab.\n\nThis is a follow-up notification for SSL/TLS CA certification expiration. If you believe you have already finished this work and still received this email, it is likely because you created new instances using the 2019 Certificate Authority (CA). After January 25, 2024 all newly created instances that do not explicitly specify a different CA will use the ‘rds-ca-rsa2048-g1’ CA. For information on setting an account level CA override, see the modify-certificates API documentation [1].\n\nIf your applications connect to these instances using the SSL/TLS protocol, you will need to take action before August 22, 2024 to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances. Even if you do not currently use SSL for your connections, you could still be affected if your databases server certificate expires, so we still recommend updating your CA.\n\nTo protect your communications with your database instances, a CA generates time-bound certificates that are checked by your database client software to authenticate any database instance before exchanging information. Following industry best practices, AWS renews the CA and creates new certificates on a routine basis to ensure customer connections are properly protected for years to come. The current CA in the EU-WEST-1 Region will expire on August 22, 2024. Before this date you will need to update your DB server certificate. The following is the general process to do this:\n\nFirst, update your application clients with the new certificate, if your application client is using a trust store then add the new CA certificates into the trust stores of your client applications. RDS provides download links to the CA certificates in our User Guide [2]. For more detailed instructions on updating the trust stores on your client application see our documentation [3].\n\nSecond, update the certificate on all your affected database instances to one of the newly issued CAs. ‘rds-ca-rsa2048-g1’ is the default recommended CA because there is no algorithm change. The other CAs use new key algorithms so it could require more testing of your client setup to ensure compatibility. For more information on the new CAs see our documentation [4].\n\nThird, if you want to use a different CA than the default ‘rds-ca-rsa2048-g1’, you will need to set an account level CA override so your new instances will use the CA of your choice. To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later. For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs. \n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the ‘rds-ca-rsa2048-g1’ certificate. If you wish for new instances to use a different certificate, you can specify which certificate to use with the AWS console or the AWS CLI. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\n3. After August 22, 2024 - ‘rds-ca-2019’ will expire. You will need to take action before August 22, 2024, to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances.\n\nFor more information see our blog [9], and if you have questions or concerns, please contact AWS Support [10].\n\n[1] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/modify-certificates.html\n[2] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.CertificatesAllRegions\n[3] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation-updating\n[4] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.RegionCertificateAuthorities\n[5] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-certificates.html\n[6] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/create-db-instance.html\n[7] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[8] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[9] https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/rotate-your-ssl-tls-certificates-now-amazon-rds-and-amazon-aurora-expire-in-2024/\n[10] https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home",

		"Description": "[AWS Health may periodically trigger reminder notifications about this communication.]\n\nYou are receiving this message because your AWS Account has one or more Amazon RDS, or Amazon Aurora database instances in the EU-WEST-1 Region using a SSL/TLS Certificate that is expiring on August 22, 2024.  \n\nA list of your affected resources can be found in the 'Affected resources' tab.\n\nThis is a follow-up notification for SSL/TLS CA certification expiration. If you believe you have already finished this work and still received this email, it is likely because you created new instances using the 2019 Certificate Authority (CA). After January 25, 2024 all newly created instances that do not explicitly specify a different CA will use the ‘rds-ca-rsa2048-g1’ CA. For information on setting an account level CA override, see the modify-certificates API documentation [1].\n\nIf your applications connect to these instances using the SSL/TLS protocol, you will need to take action before August 22, 2024 to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances. Even if you do not currently use SSL for your connections, you could still be affected if your databases server certificate expires, so we still recommend updating your CA.\n\nTo protect your communications with your database instances, a CA generates time-bound certificates that are checked by your database client software to authenticate any database instance before exchanging information. Following industry best practices, AWS renews the CA and creates new certificates on a routine basis to ensure customer connections are properly protected for years to come. The current CA in the EU-WEST-1 Region will expire on August 22, 2024. Before this date you will need to update your DB server certificate. The following is the general process to do this:\n\nFirst, update your application clients with the new certificate, if your application client is using a trust store then add the new CA certificates into the trust stores of your client applications. RDS provides download links to the CA certificates in our User Guide [2]. For more detailed instructions on updating the trust stores on your client application see our documentation [3].\n\nSecond, update the certificate on all your affected database instances to one of the newly issued CAs. ‘rds-ca-rsa2048-g1’ is the default recommended CA because there is no algorithm change. The other CAs use new key algorithms so it could require more testing of your client setup to ensure compatibility. For more information on the new CAs see our documentation [4].\n\nThird, if you want to use a different CA than the default ‘rds-ca-rsa2048-g1’, you will need to set an account level CA override so your new instances will use the CA of your choice. To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later. For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs. \n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the ‘rds-ca-rsa2048-g1’ certificate.

		"Description": "[AWS Health may periodically trigger reminder notifications about this communication.]\n\nYou are receiving this message because your AWS Account has one or more Amazon RDS, or Amazon Aurora database instances in the EU-WEST-1 Region using a SSL/TLS Certificate that is expiring on August 22, 2024.  \n\nA list of your affected resources can be found in the 'Affected resources' tab.\n\nThis is a follow-up notification for SSL/TLS CA certification expiration. If you believe you have already finished this work and still received this email, it is likely because you created new instances using the 2019 Certificate Authority (CA). After January 25, 2024 all newly created instances that do not explicitly specify a different CA will use the ‘rds-ca-rsa2048-g1’ CA. For information on setting an account level CA override, see the modify-certificates API documentation [1].\n\nIf your applications connect to these instances using the SSL/TLS protocol, you will need to take action before August 22, 2024 to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances. Even if you do not currently use SSL for your connections, you could still be affected if your databases server certificate expires, so we still recommend updating your CA.\n\nTo protect your communications with your database instances, a CA generates time-bound certificates that are checked by your database client software to authenticate any database instance before exchanging information. Following industry best practices, AWS renews the CA and creates new certificates on a routine basis to ensure customer connections are properly protected for years to come. The current CA in the EU-WEST-1 Region will expire on August 22, 2024. Before this date you will need to update your DB server certificate. The following is the general process to do this:\n\nFirst, update your application clients with the new certificate, if your application client is using a trust store then add the new CA certificates into the trust stores of your client applications. RDS provides download links to the CA certificates in our User Guide [2]. For more detailed instructions on updating the trust stores on your client application see our documentation [3].\n\nSecond, update the certificate on all your affected database instances to one of the newly issued CAs. ‘rds-ca-rsa2048-g1’ is the default recommended CA because there is no algorithm change. The other CAs use new key algorithms so it could require more testing of your client setup to ensure compatibility. For more information on the new CAs see our documentation [4].\n\nThird, if you want to use a different CA than the default ‘rds-ca-rsa2048-g1’, you will need to set an account level CA override so your new instances will use the CA of your choice. To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later. For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs. \n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the ‘rds-ca-rsa2048-g1’ certificate. If you wish for new instances to use a different certificate, you can specify which certificate to use with the AWS console or the AWS CLI. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\n3. After August 22, 2024 - ‘rds-ca-2019’ will expire.

		"Description": "[AWS Health may periodically trigger reminder notifications about this communication.]\n\nYou are receiving this message because your AWS Account has one or more Amazon RDS, or Amazon Aurora database instances in the EU-WEST-1 Region using a SSL/TLS Certificate that is expiring on August 22, 2024.  \n\nA list of your affected resources can be found in the 'Affected resources' tab.\n\nThis is a follow-up notification for SSL/TLS CA certification expiration. If you believe you have already finished this work and still received this email, it is likely because you created new instances using the 2019 Certificate Authority (CA). After January 25, 2024 all newly created instances that do not explicitly specify a different CA will use the ‘rds-ca-rsa2048-g1’ CA. For information on setting an account level CA override, see the modify-certificates API documentation [1].\n\nIf your applications connect to these instances using the SSL/TLS protocol, you will need to take action before August 22, 2024 to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances. Even if you do not currently use SSL for your connections, you could still be affected if your databases server certificate expires, so we still recommend updating your CA.\n\nTo protect your communications with your database instances, a CA generates time-bound certificates that are checked by your database client software to authenticate any database instance before exchanging information. Following industry best practices, AWS renews the CA and creates new certificates on a routine basis to ensure customer connections are properly protected for years to come. The current CA in the EU-WEST-1 Region will expire on August 22, 2024. Before this date you will need to update your DB server certificate. The following is the general process to do this:\n\nFirst, update your application clients with the new certificate, if your application client is using a trust store then add the new CA certificates into the trust stores of your client applications. RDS provides download links to the CA certificates in our User Guide [2]. For more detailed instructions on updating the trust stores on your client application see our documentation [3].\n\nSecond, update the certificate on all your affected database instances to one of the newly issued CAs. ‘rds-ca-rsa2048-g1’ is the default recommended CA because there is no algorithm change. The other CAs use new key algorithms so it could require more testing of your client setup to ensure compatibility. For more information on the new CAs see our documentation [4].\n\nThird, if you want to use a different CA than the default ‘rds-ca-rsa2048-g1’, you will need to set an account level CA override so your new instances will use the CA of your choice. To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later. For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs. \n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the ‘rds-ca-rsa2048-g1’ certificate. If you wish for new instances to use a different certificate, you can specify which certificate to use with the AWS console or the AWS CLI. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\n3. After August 22, 2024 - ‘rds-ca-2019’ will expire. You will need to take action before August 22, 2024, to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances.\n\nFor more information see our blog [9], and if you have questions or concerns, please contact AWS Support [10].\n\n[1] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/modify-certificates.html\n[2] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.CertificatesAllRegions\n[3] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation-updating\n[4] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.RegionCertificateAuthorities\n[5] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-certificates.html\n[6] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/create-db-instance.html\n[7] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[8] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[9] https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/rotate-your-ssl-tls-certificates-now-amazon-rds-and-amazon-aurora-expire-in-2024/\n[10] https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home",

For more detailed instructions on updating the trust stores on your client application see our documentation [3].\n\nSecond, update the certificate on all your affected database instances to one of the newly issued CAs. ‘rds-ca-rsa2048-g1’ is the default recommended CA because there is no algorithm change. The other CAs use new key algorithms so it could require more testing of your client setup to ensure compatibility. For more information on the new CAs see our documentation [4].\n\nThird, if you want to use a different CA than the default ‘rds-ca-rsa2048-g1’, you will need to set an account level CA override so your new instances will use the CA of your choice. To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later. For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs. \n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the ‘rds-ca-rsa2048-g1’ certificate. If you wish for new instances to use a different certificate, you can specify which certificate to use with the AWS console or the AWS CLI. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\n3. After August 22, 2024 - ‘rds-ca-2019’ will expire. You will need to take action before August 22, 2024, to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances.\n\nFor more information see our blog [9], and if you have questions or concerns, please contact AWS Support [10].\n\n[1] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/modify-certificates.html\n[2] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.CertificatesAllRegions\n[3] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation-updating\n[4] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.RegionCertificateAuthorities\n[5] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-certificates.html\n[6] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/create-db-instance.html\n[7] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[8] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[9] https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/rotate-your-ssl-tls-certificates-now-amazon-rds-and-amazon-aurora-expire-in-2024/\n[10] https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home",

If you believe you have already finished this work and still received this email, it is likely because you created new instances using the 2019 Certificate Authority (CA). After January 25, 2024 all newly created instances that do not explicitly specify a different CA will use the ‘rds-ca-rsa2048-g1’ CA. For information on setting an account level CA override, see the modify-certificates API documentation [1].\n\nIf your applications connect to these instances using the SSL/TLS protocol, you will need to take action before August 22, 2024 to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances. Even if you do not currently use SSL for your connections, you could still be affected if your databases server certificate expires, so we still recommend updating your CA.\n\nTo protect your communications with your database instances, a CA generates time-bound certificates that are checked by your database client software to authenticate any database instance before exchanging information. Following industry best practices, AWS renews the CA and creates new certificates on a routine basis to ensure customer connections are properly protected for years to come. The current CA in the EU-WEST-1 Region will expire on August 22, 2024. Before this date you will need to update your DB server certificate.

		"Description": "[AWS Health may periodically trigger reminder notifications about this communication.]\n\nYou are receiving this message because your AWS Account has one or more Amazon RDS, or Amazon Aurora database instances in the EU-WEST-1 Region using a SSL/TLS Certificate that is expiring on August 22, 2024.  \n\nA list of your affected resources can be found in the 'Affected resources' tab.\n\nThis is a follow-up notification for SSL/TLS CA certification expiration. If you believe you have already finished this work and still received this email, it is likely because you created new instances using the 2019 Certificate Authority (CA). After January 25, 2024 all newly created instances that do not explicitly specify a different CA will use the ‘rds-ca-rsa2048-g1’ CA. For information on setting an account level CA override, see the modify-certificates API documentation [1].\n\nIf your applications connect to these instances using the SSL/TLS protocol, you will need to take action before August 22, 2024 to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances. Even if you do not currently use SSL for your connections, you could still be affected if your databases server certificate expires, so we still recommend updating your CA.\n\nTo protect your communications with your database instances, a CA generates time-bound certificates that are checked by your database client software to authenticate any database instance before exchanging information. Following industry best practices, AWS renews the CA and creates new certificates on a routine basis to ensure customer connections are properly protected for years to come. The current CA in the EU-WEST-1 Region will expire on August 22, 2024. Before this date you will need to update your DB server certificate. The following is the general process to do this:\n\nFirst, update your application clients with the new certificate, if your application client is using a trust store then add the new CA certificates into the trust stores of your client applications. RDS provides download links to the CA certificates in our User Guide [2]. For more detailed instructions on updating the trust stores on your client application see our documentation [3].\n\nSecond, update the certificate on all your affected database instances to one of the newly issued CAs. ‘rds-ca-rsa2048-g1’ is the default recommended CA because there is no algorithm change. The other CAs use new key algorithms so it could require more testing of your client setup to ensure compatibility. For more information on the new CAs see our documentation [4].\n\nThird, if you want to use a different CA than the default ‘rds-ca-rsa2048-g1’, you will need to set an account level CA override so your new instances will use the CA of your choice. To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later. For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs. \n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the ‘rds-ca-rsa2048-g1’ certificate. If you wish for new instances to use a different certificate, you can specify which certificate to use with the AWS console or the AWS CLI. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\n3. After August 22, 2024 - ‘rds-ca-2019’ will expire. You will need to take action before August 22, 2024, to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances.\n\nFor more information see our blog [9], and if you have questions or concerns, please contact AWS Support [10].\n\n[1] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/modify-certificates.html\n[2] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.CertificatesAllRegions\n[3] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation-updating\n[4] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.RegionCertificateAuthorities\n[5] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-certificates.html\n[6] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/create-db-instance.html\n[7] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[8] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[9] https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/rotate-your-ssl-tls-certificates-now-amazon-rds-and-amazon-aurora-expire-in-2024/\n[10] https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home",

You can disregard this notification if you are no longer running these database instances or have already upgraded them to new generation instance types.\n\nIn June 2023, Amazon RDS announced the deprecation of M4, R4, and T2 database instance types on Amazon RDS for MySQL, MariaDB, and PostgreSQL.\n\nStarting March 11, 2024, Amazon RDS will begin disabling the creation of Amazon RDS for MySQL, MariaDB, and PostgreSQL database instances running on M4, R4, or T2 instance types. And starting on June 1, 2024, Amazon RDS will make best effort to begin upgrading MySQL, MariaDB, and PostgreSQL database instances running on M4, R4, or T2 instance types to equivalent size M5, R5, or T3 newer generation instance type, if available. \n\nWe strongly recommend that you migrate your existing Amazon RDS database instances running M4, R4, and T2 instance types to newer generation instance types before May 31, 2024. You may use the following recommendation:\n\n* Upgrade M4 instance to M5 instance or higher\n* Upgrade R4 instance to R5 instance or higher\n* Upgrade T2 instance to T3 instance or higher\n\nA list of your impacted resource(s) can be found in the 'Affected resources' tab.\n\nHow will my Amazon RDS Reserved Instances (RIs) be impacted?\n\nIf you upgrade your instance types that are receiving a billing benefit from RIs, the RIs will no longer cover the database instances and you may see additional on-demand charges on your bill. To avoid this, we recommend the following:\n\n* If you have no RIs, or if your RIs have expired, you should migrate your instances at the earliest convenience.\n* If you have active RIs which expire before June 1, 2024, you should wait for the RIs to expire and then migrate your instances. You can then purchase new RIs for the upgraded instance types.\n* If you have RIs which will be active after May 31, 2024, you should not migrate your instances. RDS will automatically upgrade database instances and RIs that are active after May 31, 2024. \n\nTo seamlessly upgrade your database’s instance type or engine version, you may consider using RDS Blue Green Deployments [1] for RDS MySQL and RDS PostgreSQL.

You can disregard this notification if you are no longer running these database instances or have already upgraded them to new generation instance types.\n\nIn June 2023, Amazon RDS announced the deprecation of M4, R4, and T2 database instance types on Amazon RDS for MySQL, MariaDB, and PostgreSQL.\n\nStarting March 11, 2024, Amazon RDS will begin disabling the creation of Amazon RDS for MySQL, MariaDB, and PostgreSQL database instances running on M4, R4, or T2 instance types. And starting on June 1, 2024, Amazon RDS will make best effort to begin upgrading MySQL, MariaDB, and PostgreSQL database instances running on M4, R4, or T2 instance types to equivalent size M5, R5, or T3 newer generation instance type, if available. \n\nWe strongly recommend that you migrate your existing Amazon RDS database instances running M4, R4, and T2 instance types to newer generation instance types before May 31, 2024. You may use the following recommendation:\n\n* Upgrade M4 instance to M5 instance or higher\n* Upgrade R4 instance to R5 instance or higher\n* Upgrade T2 instance to T3 instance or higher\n\nA list of your impacted resource(s) can be found in the 'Affected resources' tab.\n\nHow will my Amazon RDS Reserved Instances (RIs) be impacted?\n\nIf you upgrade your instance types that are receiving a billing benefit from RIs, the RIs will no longer cover the database instances and you may see additional on-demand charges on your bill. To avoid this, we recommend the following:\n\n* If you have no RIs, or if your RIs have expired, you should migrate your instances at the earliest convenience.\n* If you have active RIs which expire before June 1, 2024, you should wait for the RIs to expire and then migrate your instances. You can then purchase new RIs for the upgraded instance types.\n* If you have RIs which will be active after May 31, 2024, you should not migrate your instances. RDS will automatically upgrade database instances and RIs that are active after May 31, 2024. \n\nTo seamlessly upgrade your database’s instance type or engine version, you may consider using RDS Blue Green Deployments [1] for RDS MySQL and RDS PostgreSQL. If you have any questions or concerns, please reach out to AWS Support [2].\n\n[1] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/blue-green-deployments.html\n[2] https://aws.amazon.com/support",

		"Description": "You are receiving this message because you have one or more Amazon RDS for MySQL DB instances running major version 5.7 that require your attention. The MySQL community has deprecated MySQL 5.7 in October, 2023 [1], and it will not receive any security patches after October, 2023. Therefore, Amazon RDS will end standard support of MySQL major version 5.7 on February 29, 2024.\n\nWe recommend that you take action and upgrade your Amazon RDS for MySQL databases (DB) running major version 5.7 to major version 8.0 before end of standard support in February, 2024. Amazon RDS for MySQL 8.0 offers new query functionality, enhancements for better performance, reliability, security and manageability. To learn more about the benefits of MySQL 8.0, refer to ‘Amazon RDS for MySQL 8.0 Announcement’ [2].\n\nIf you do not upgrade your RDS for MySQL 5.7 databases to MySQL 8.0 by February 29, 2024, they will be automatically enrolled into Amazon RDS Extended Support [3] to optimize availability of your database(s). \n\nWhat does this change mean? \n\nYou will see three things as a result of this change: \n\n* First, we will not auto-upgrade your database(s). You will have to upgrade your database to MySQL 8.0 when you are ready. You must complete your upgrade before the end of RDS Extended Support for MySQL 5.7 on February 28, 2027. \n* Starting on March 1, 2024, you will start to be charged [4] for Amazon RDS Extended Support on all Amazon RDS for MySQL 5.7 database instances that are still active. The charges for Amazon RDS Extended Support service will stop when you upgrade your database instance to MySQL 8.0. You can avoid Amazon RDS Extended Support charges entirely by upgrading to MySQL 8.0 before March 1, 2024. \n* Starting on March 1, 2024, you can create new Amazon RDS for MySQL 5.7 instances only in Amazon RDS Extended Support mode.\n\nWhat do you need to do?\n\nYour next steps depend on whether you want to run your Amazon RDS for MySQL 5.7 databases beyond February 29, 2024. \n\n* If you plan to run your Amazon RDS for MySQL 5.7 database instances beyond February 29, 2024, you do not need to take any action. Your instance/cluster will be automatically enrolled into Amazon RDS Extended Support, and you will be billed for Extended Support starting March 1, 2024. Note, if you are running a minor version lower than MySQL 5.7.44, your database will be auto-upgraded to MySQL 5.7.44 starting on March 1, 2024. If you do not want to be auto-upgraded to MySQL 5.7.44, we recommend that you upgrade to this version manually before February 29, 2024.\n* If you do not intend to run your Amazon RDS for MySQL 5.7 database instances beyond February 29, 2024, or you do not want to incur expenses for Amazon RDS Extended Support, we recommend you upgrade your databases from MySQL 5.7 to MySQL 8.0 by February 29, 2024. Consider using Amazon RDS Blue/Green Deployments [5] to minimize risk and downtime during your MySQL 5.7 to MySQL 8.0 upgrade. \n\nYour Amazon RDS for MySQL instances running version 5.7 are listed in \"Affected resources\" tab. \n\nIf you have any questions or concerns, the AWS Support Team is available on AWS re:Post [6] and via AWS Support [7].\n\n[1] https://www.mysql.com/support/\n[2] https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2018/10/amazon-rds-now-supports-mysql-8/\n[3] https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2023/09/amazon-aurora-rds-extended-support-mysql-postgresql-databases/\n[4] https://aws.amazon.com/rds/mysql/pricing/\n[5] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/blue-green-deployments.html\n[6] https://repost.aws\n[7] https://aws.amazon.com/support",

Therefore, Amazon RDS will end standard support of PostgreSQL major version 11 on February 29, 2024.\n\nWe recommend that you take action and upgrade your PostgreSQL DBs running major version 11 to a higher major version, such as Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL 16, before end of standard support on February 29, 2024. Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL 16 includes support for logical decoding on read replicas, logical replication from standbys, and over 90 PostgreSQL extensions such as pgactive, pgvector, pg_tle, h3-pg, pg_cron, and rdkit. PostgreSQL 16 introduces a number of performance and visibility improvements including greater query parallelism, SIMD CPU acceleration, and a 'pg_stat_io' view that provides statistics on I/O usage. Further, with PostgreSQL 16, developers can now use SQL/JSON constructors and identity functions [2].\n\nIf you do not upgrade your RDS for PostgreSQL 11 databases to a higher major version by February 29, 2024, they will be automatically enrolled into Amazon RDS Extended Support [3] to optimize for availability of your database. \n\nWhat does this change mean?  \n\nYou will see three things as a result of this change:\n\n* First, we will not auto-upgrade your database(s). You will have to upgrade your database to PostgreSQL 12 or higher when you are ready. You must complete your upgrade before the end of RDS Extended Support for PostgreSQL 11 on February 28, 2027. \n* Starting on March 1, 2024, you can create new Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL 11 instances only in Amazon RDS Extended Support mode.\n* Starting on April 1, 2024, you will start to be charged [4] for Amazon RDS Extended Support on all Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL 11 database instances that are still active. The charges for Amazon RDS Extended Support service will stop when you upgrade your database instance to PostgreSQL 12 or higher. You can avoid Amazon RDS Extended Support charges entirely by upgrading to PostgreSQL 12 or higher before April 1, 2024.\n\nWhat do you need to do? \n\nYour next steps depend on whether you want to run your Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL 11 databases beyond March 31, 2024. \n\n* If you plan to run your Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL 11 database instances beyond February 29, 2024, you do not need to take any action. Your instance/cluster will be automatically enrolled into Amazon RDS Extended Support, and you will be billed for Extended Support starting April 1, 2024. Note, if you are running a minor version lower than PostgreSQL 11.22, your database will be auto-upgraded to PostgreSQL 11.22 starting on April 1, 2024. If you do not want to be auto-upgraded to PostgreSQL 11.22, we recommend that you upgrade to this version manually before March 31, 2024.\n* If you do not intend to run your Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL 11 database instances beyond March 31, 2024, or you do not want to incur expenses for Amazon RDS Extended Support, we recommend you upgrade your databases from PostgreSQL 11 to PostgreSQL 12 or higher by March 31, 2024.

This follows Node.js 16 End-Of-Life (EOL) reached on September 11, 2023 [1].\n\nAs described in the Lambda runtime support policy [2], end of support for language runtimes in Lambda happens in several stages. Starting on June 12, 2024, Lambda will no longer apply security patches and other updates to the Node.js 16 runtime used by Lambda functions, and functions using Node.js 16 will no longer be eligible for technical support. Also, Node.js 16 will no longer be available in the Console, although you can still create and update functions using Node.js 16 via AWS CloudFormation, the AWS CLI, AWS SAM, or other tools. Starting July 15, 2024, you will no longer be able to create new Lambda functions using the Node.js 16 runtime. Starting August 15, 2024, you will no longer be able to update existing functions using the Node.js 16 runtime.\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your existing Node.js 16 functions to Node.js 20 before June 12, 2024. A list of your Node.js 16 functions can be found in the 'Affected resources' tab of the AWS Health Dashboard.\n\nEnd of support does not impact function execution. Your functions will continue to run. However, they will be running on an unsupported runtime which is no longer maintained or patched by the AWS Lambda team.\n\nThis notification is generated for functions using the Node.js 16 runtime for the $LATEST function version. The following command shows how to use the AWS CLI [3] to list all functions in a specific region using Node.js 16, including published function versions. To find all such functions in your account, repeat this command for each Region:\n\naws lambda list-functions --region us-west-2 --output text --query \"Functions[?Runtime=='nodejs16.x'].FunctionArn\"\n\nFrom 180 days before deprecation, you can also use Trusted Advisor to identify all functions using the Node.js 16 runtime, including published function versions [4].\n\nIf you have any concerns or require further assistance, please contact AWS Support [5].\n\n[1] https://github.com/nodejs/Release\n[2] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/runtime-support-policy.html\n[3] https://aws.amazon.com/cli/\n[4] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awssupport/latest/user/security-checks.html#aws-lambda-functions-deprecated-runtimes\n[5] https://aws.amazon.com/support",

		"Description": "[AWS Health may periodically trigger reminder notifications about this communication.]\n\nYou are receiving this message because your AWS Account has one or more Amazon RDS, or Amazon Aurora database instances in the US-EAST-1 Region using a SSL/TLS Certificate that is expiring on August 22, 2024.  \n\nA list of your affected resources can be found in the 'Affected resources' tab.\n\nThis is a follow-up notification for SSL/TLS CA certification expiration. If you believe you have already finished this work and still received this email, it is likely because you created new instances using the 2019 Certificate Authority (CA). After January 25, 2024 all newly created instances that do not explicitly specify a different CA will use the ‘rds-ca-rsa2048-g1’ CA. For information on setting an account level CA override, see the modify-certificates API documentation [1].\n\nIf your applications connect to these instances using the SSL/TLS protocol, you will need to take action before August 22, 2024 to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances. Even if you do not currently use SSL for your connections, you could still be affected if your databases server certificate expires, so we still recommend updating your CA.\n\nTo protect your communications with your database instances, a CA generates time-bound certificates that are checked by your database client software to authenticate any database instance before exchanging information. Following industry best practices, AWS renews the CA and creates new certificates on a routine basis to ensure customer connections are properly protected for years to come. The current CA in the US-EAST-1 Region will expire on August 22, 2024. Before this date you will need to update your DB server certificate. The following is the general process to do this:\n\nFirst, update your application clients with the new certificate, if your application client is using a trust store then add the new CA certificates into the trust stores of your client applications. RDS provides download links to the CA certificates in our User Guide [2]. For more detailed instructions on updating the trust stores on your client application see our documentation [3].\n\nSecond, update the certificate on all your affected database instances to one of the newly issued CAs. ‘rds-ca-rsa2048-g1’ is the default recommended CA because there is no algorithm change. The other CAs use new key algorithms so it could require more testing of your client setup to ensure compatibility. For more information on the new CAs see our documentation [4].\n\nThird, if you want to use a different CA than the default ‘rds-ca-rsa2048-g1’, you will need to set an account level CA override so your new instances will use the CA of your choice. To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later. For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs. \n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the ‘rds-ca-rsa2048-g1’ certificate.

		"Description": "[AWS Health may periodically trigger reminder notifications about this communication.]\n\nYou are receiving this message because your AWS Account has one or more Amazon RDS, or Amazon Aurora database instances in the US-EAST-1 Region using a SSL/TLS Certificate that is expiring on August 22, 2024.  \n\nA list of your affected resources can be found in the 'Affected resources' tab.\n\nThis is a follow-up notification for SSL/TLS CA certification expiration. If you believe you have already finished this work and still received this email, it is likely because you created new instances using the 2019 Certificate Authority (CA). After January 25, 2024 all newly created instances that do not explicitly specify a different CA will use the ‘rds-ca-rsa2048-g1’ CA. For information on setting an account level CA override, see the modify-certificates API documentation [1].\n\nIf your applications connect to these instances using the SSL/TLS protocol, you will need to take action before August 22, 2024 to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances. Even if you do not currently use SSL for your connections, you could still be affected if your databases server certificate expires, so we still recommend updating your CA.\n\nTo protect your communications with your database instances, a CA generates time-bound certificates that are checked by your database client software to authenticate any database instance before exchanging information. Following industry best practices, AWS renews the CA and creates new certificates on a routine basis to ensure customer connections are properly protected for years to come. The current CA in the US-EAST-1 Region will expire on August 22, 2024. Before this date you will need to update your DB server certificate. The following is the general process to do this:\n\nFirst, update your application clients with the new certificate, if your application client is using a trust store then add the new CA certificates into the trust stores of your client applications. RDS provides download links to the CA certificates in our User Guide [2]. For more detailed instructions on updating the trust stores on your client application see our documentation [3].\n\nSecond, update the certificate on all your affected database instances to one of the newly issued CAs. ‘rds-ca-rsa2048-g1’ is the default recommended CA because there is no algorithm change. The other CAs use new key algorithms so it could require more testing of your client setup to ensure compatibility. For more information on the new CAs see our documentation [4].\n\nThird, if you want to use a different CA than the default ‘rds-ca-rsa2048-g1’, you will need to set an account level CA override so your new instances will use the CA of your choice. To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later. For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs. \n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the ‘rds-ca-rsa2048-g1’ certificate. If you wish for new instances to use a different certificate, you can specify which certificate to use with the AWS console or the AWS CLI.

For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs. \n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the ‘rds-ca-rsa2048-g1’ certificate. If you wish for new instances to use a different certificate, you can specify which certificate to use with the AWS console or the AWS CLI. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\n3. After August 22, 2024 - ‘rds-ca-2019’ will expire. You will need to take action before August 22, 2024, to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances.\n\nFor more information see our blog [9], and if you have questions or concerns, please contact AWS Support [10].\n\n[1] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/modify-certificates.html\n[2] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.CertificatesAllRegions\n[3] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation-updating\n[4] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.RegionCertificateAuthorities\n[5] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-certificates.html\n[6] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/create-db-instance.html\n[7] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[8] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[9] https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/rotate-your-ssl-tls-certificates-now-amazon-rds-and-amazon-aurora-expire-in-2024/\n[10] https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home",

		"Description": "[AWS Health may periodically trigger reminder notifications about this communication.]\n\nYou are receiving this message because your AWS Account has one or more Amazon RDS, or Amazon Aurora database instances in the US-EAST-1 Region using a SSL/TLS Certificate that is expiring on August 22, 2024.  \n\nA list of your affected resources can be found in the 'Affected resources' tab.\n\nThis is a follow-up notification for SSL/TLS CA certification expiration. If you believe you have already finished this work and still received this email, it is likely because you created new instances using the 2019 Certificate Authority (CA). After January 25, 2024 all newly created instances that do not explicitly specify a different CA will use the ‘rds-ca-rsa2048-g1’ CA. For information on setting an account level CA override, see the modify-certificates API documentation [1].\n\nIf your applications connect to these instances using the SSL/TLS protocol, you will need to take action before August 22, 2024 to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances. Even if you do not currently use SSL for your connections, you could still be affected if your databases server certificate expires, so we still recommend updating your CA.\n\nTo protect your communications with your database instances, a CA generates time-bound certificates that are checked by your database client software to authenticate any database instance before exchanging information. Following industry best practices, AWS renews the CA and creates new certificates on a routine basis to ensure customer connections are properly protected for years to come. The current CA in the US-EAST-1 Region will expire on August 22, 2024. Before this date you will need to update your DB server certificate. The following is the general process to do this:\n\nFirst, update your application clients with the new certificate, if your application client is using a trust store then add the new CA certificates into the trust stores of your client applications. RDS provides download links to the CA certificates in our User Guide [2]. For more detailed instructions on updating the trust stores on your client application see our documentation [3].\n\nSecond, update the certificate on all your affected database instances to one of the newly issued CAs. ‘rds-ca-rsa2048-g1’ is the default recommended CA because there is no algorithm change. The other CAs use new key algorithms so it could require more testing of your client setup to ensure compatibility. For more information on the new CAs see our documentation [4].\n\nThird, if you want to use a different CA than the default ‘rds-ca-rsa2048-g1’, you will need to set an account level CA override so your new instances will use the CA of your choice.

		"Description": "[AWS Health may periodically trigger reminder notifications about this communication.]\n\nYou are receiving this message because your AWS Account has one or more Amazon RDS, or Amazon Aurora database instances in the US-EAST-1 Region using a SSL/TLS Certificate that is expiring on August 22, 2024.  \n\nA list of your affected resources can be found in the 'Affected resources' tab.\n\nThis is a follow-up notification for SSL/TLS CA certification expiration. If you believe you have already finished this work and still received this email, it is likely because you created new instances using the 2019 Certificate Authority (CA). After January 25, 2024 all newly created instances that do not explicitly specify a different CA will use the ‘rds-ca-rsa2048-g1’ CA. For information on setting an account level CA override, see the modify-certificates API documentation [1].\n\nIf your applications connect to these instances using the SSL/TLS protocol, you will need to take action before August 22, 2024 to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances. Even if you do not currently use SSL for your connections, you could still be affected if your databases server certificate expires, so we still recommend updating your CA.\n\nTo protect your communications with your database instances, a CA generates time-bound certificates that are checked by your database client software to authenticate any database instance before exchanging information. Following industry best practices, AWS renews the CA and creates new certificates on a routine basis to ensure customer connections are properly protected for years to come. The current CA in the US-EAST-1 Region will expire on August 22, 2024. Before this date you will need to update your DB server certificate. The following is the general process to do this:\n\nFirst, update your application clients with the new certificate, if your application client is using a trust store then add the new CA certificates into the trust stores of your client applications. RDS provides download links to the CA certificates in our User Guide [2]. For more detailed instructions on updating the trust stores on your client application see our documentation [3].\n\nSecond, update the certificate on all your affected database instances to one of the newly issued CAs. ‘rds-ca-rsa2048-g1’ is the default recommended CA because there is no algorithm change. The other CAs use new key algorithms so it could require more testing of your client setup to ensure compatibility. For more information on the new CAs see our documentation [4].\n\nThird, if you want to use a different CA than the default ‘rds-ca-rsa2048-g1’, you will need to set an account level CA override so your new instances will use the CA of your choice. To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later. For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs. \n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the ‘rds-ca-rsa2048-g1’ certificate. If you wish for new instances to use a different certificate, you can specify which certificate to use with the AWS console or the AWS CLI. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\n3. After August 22, 2024 - ‘rds-ca-2019’ will expire. You will need to take action before August 22, 2024, to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances.\n\nFor more information see our blog [9], and if you have questions or concerns, please contact AWS Support [10].\n\n[1] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/modify-certificates.html\n[2] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.CertificatesAllRegions\n[3] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation-updating\n[4] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.RegionCertificateAuthorities\n[5] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-certificates.html\n[6] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/create-db-instance.html\n[7] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[8] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[9] https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/rotate-your-ssl-tls-certificates-now-amazon-rds-and-amazon-aurora-expire-in-2024/\n[10] https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home",

This follows Node.js 16 End-Of-Life (EOL) reached on September 11, 2023 [1].\n\nAs described in the Lambda runtime support policy [2], end of support for language runtimes in Lambda happens in several stages. Starting on June 12, 2024, Lambda will no longer apply security patches and other updates to the Node.js 16 runtime used by Lambda functions, and functions using Node.js 16 will no longer be eligible for technical support. Also, Node.js 16 will no longer be available in the Console, although you can still create and update functions using Node.js 16 via AWS CloudFormation, the AWS CLI, AWS SAM, or other tools. Starting July 15, 2024, you will no longer be able to create new Lambda functions using the Node.js 16 runtime. Starting August 15, 2024, you will no longer be able to update existing functions using the Node.js 16 runtime.\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your existing Node.js 16 functions to Node.js 20 before June 12, 2024. A list of your Node.js 16 functions can be found in the 'Affected resources' tab of the AWS Health Dashboard.\n\nEnd of support does not impact function execution. Your functions will continue to run. However, they will be running on an unsupported runtime which is no longer maintained or patched by the AWS Lambda team.\n\nThis notification is generated for functions using the Node.js 16 runtime for the $LATEST function version.

		"Description": "You are receiving this message because you have one or more Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL Database (DB) instances running major version 11 that require your attention. The PostgreSQL community has deprecated PostgreSQL 11 after the 11.22 release [1] and it will not receive any security patches beyond the final community release. Therefore, Amazon RDS will end standard support of PostgreSQL major version 11 on February 29, 2024.\n\nWe recommend that you take action and upgrade your PostgreSQL DBs running major version 11 to a higher major version, such as Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL 16, before end of standard support on February 29, 2024. Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL 16 includes support for logical decoding on read replicas, logical replication from standbys, and over 90 PostgreSQL extensions such as pgactive, pgvector, pg_tle, h3-pg, pg_cron, and rdkit. PostgreSQL 16 introduces a number of performance and visibility improvements including greater query parallelism, SIMD CPU acceleration, and a 'pg_stat_io' view that provides statistics on I/O usage. Further, with PostgreSQL 16, developers can now use SQL/JSON constructors and identity functions [2].\n\nIf you do not upgrade your RDS for PostgreSQL 11 databases to a higher major version by February 29, 2024, they will be automatically enrolled into Amazon RDS Extended Support [3] to optimize for availability of your database. \n\nWhat does this change mean?  \n\nYou will see three things as a result of this change:\n\n* First, we will not auto-upgrade your database(s). You will have to upgrade your database to PostgreSQL 12 or higher when you are ready. You must complete your upgrade before the end of RDS Extended Support for PostgreSQL 11 on February 28, 2027. \n* Starting on March 1, 2024, you can create new Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL 11 instances only in Amazon RDS Extended Support mode.\n* Starting on April 1, 2024, you will start to be charged [4] for Amazon RDS Extended Support on all Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL 11 database instances that are still active. The charges for Amazon RDS Extended Support service will stop when you upgrade your database instance to PostgreSQL 12 or higher. You can avoid Amazon RDS Extended Support charges entirely by upgrading to PostgreSQL 12 or higher before April 1, 2024.\n\nWhat do you need to do? \n\nYour next steps depend on whether you want to run your Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL 11 databases beyond March 31, 2024. \n\n* If you plan to run your Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL 11 database instances beyond February 29, 2024, you do not need to take any action. Your instance/cluster will be automatically enrolled into Amazon RDS Extended Support, and you will be billed for Extended Support starting April 1, 2024. Note, if you are running a minor version lower than PostgreSQL 11.22, your database will be auto-upgraded to PostgreSQL 11.22 starting on April 1, 2024. If you do not want to be auto-upgraded to PostgreSQL 11.22, we recommend that you upgrade to this version manually before March 31, 2024.\n* If you do not intend to run your Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL 11 database instances beyond March 31, 2024, or you do not want to incur expenses for Amazon RDS Extended Support, we recommend you upgrade your databases from PostgreSQL 11 to PostgreSQL 12 or higher by March 31, 2024.

Kubernetes version 1.24 will stay in extended support until January 31, 2025, after which this version will no longer be supported on Amazon EKS. You will no longer be able to create new Kubernetes version 1.24 clusters after January 31, 2025, and all EKS clusters running this version will be updated to Kubernetes version 1.25 through a gradual deployment process.\n\nYou are receiving this message because you currently have 1 or more EKS clusters running with Kubernetes version 1.24, listed in the 'Affected resources' tab.\n\nExtended support is currently in preview and is available for free to all customers. When extended support is generally available in early 2024, there will be an additional per cluster per hour charge for all clusters running an extended support version. Pricing information will be announced when the feature is generally available. \n\nIf you do not want to use extended support, we recommend that you update your 1.24 clusters to Kubernetes version 1.25 or higher before the end of standard support date, January 31, 2024. To learn more about extended support for Kubernetes versions, see the launch announcement [1]. For instructions on how to update your cluster(s), see the Amazon EKS service documentation [2]. \n\nTo learn more on Kubernetes version support, see the Amazon EKS service documentation [3]. \n\nIf you have questions or concerns, please contact AWS support [4].\n\n[1] https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/amazon-eks-extended-support-for-kubernetes-versions-available-in-preview/\n[2] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/update-cluster.html\n[3] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/kubernetes-versions.html\n[4] https://support.console.aws.amazon.com/support/home?#/",
