If you believe you have already finished this work and still received this email, it is likely because you created new instances using the 2019 Certificate Authority (CA). After January 25, 2024 all newly created instances that do not explicitly specify a different CA will use the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 CA. For information on setting an account level CA override, see the modify-certificates API documentation [1].\n\nIf your applications connect to these instances using the SSL/TLS protocol, you will need to take action before August 22, 2024 to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances. Even if you do not currently use SSL for your connections, you could still be affected if your databases server certificate expires, so we still recommend updating your CA.\n\nTo protect your communications with your database instances, a CA generates time-bound certificates that are checked by your database client software to authenticate any database instance before exchanging information. Following industry best practices, AWS renews the CA and creates new certificates on a routine basis to ensure customer connections are properly protected for years to come. The current CA in the EU-WEST-1 Region will expire on August 22, 2024. Before this date you will need to update your DB server certificate. The following is the general process to do this:\n\nFirst, update your application clients with the new certificate, if your application client is using a trust store then add the new CA certificates into the trust stores of your client applications. RDS provides download links to the CA certificates in our User Guide [2]. For more detailed instructions on updating the trust stores on your client application see our documentation [3].\n\nSecond, update the certificate on all your affected database instances to one of the newly issued CAs. \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 is the default recommended CA because there is no algorithm change. The other CAs use new key algorithms so it could require more testing of your client setup to ensure compatibility. For more information on the new CAs see our documentation [4].\n\nThird, if you want to use a different CA than the default \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019, you will need to set an account level CA override so your new instances will use the CA of your choice. To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later. For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs. \n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 certificate. If you wish for new instances to use a different certificate, you can specify which certificate to use with the AWS console or the AWS CLI. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\n3. After August 22, 2024 - \u2018rds-ca-2019\u2019 will expire. You will need to take action before August 22, 2024, to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances.\n\nFor more information see our blog [9], and if you have questions or concerns, please contact AWS Support [10].\n\n[1] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/modify-certificates.html\n[2] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.CertificatesAllRegions\n[3] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation-updating\n[4] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.RegionCertificateAuthorities\n[5] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-certificates.html\n[6] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/create-db-instance.html\n[7] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[8] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[9] https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/rotate-your-ssl-tls-certificates-now-amazon-rds-and-amazon-aurora-expire-in-2024/\n[10] https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home",

If you believe you have already finished this work and still received this email, it is likely because you created new instances using the 2019 Certificate Authority (CA). After January 25, 2024 all newly created instances that do not explicitly specify a different CA will use the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 CA. For information on setting an account level CA override, see the modify-certificates API documentation [1].\n\nIf your applications connect to these instances using the SSL/TLS protocol, you will need to take action before August 22, 2024 to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances. Even if you do not currently use SSL for your connections, you could still be affected if your databases server certificate expires, so we still recommend updating your CA.\n\nTo protect your communications with your database instances, a CA generates time-bound certificates that are checked by your database client software to authenticate any database instance before exchanging information. Following industry best practices, AWS renews the CA and creates new certificates on a routine basis to ensure customer connections are properly protected for years to come. The current CA in the EU-WEST-1 Region will expire on August 22, 2024. Before this date you will need to update your DB server certificate. The following is the general process to do this:\n\nFirst, update your application clients with the new certificate, if your application client is using a trust store then add the new CA certificates into the trust stores of your client applications. RDS provides download links to the CA certificates in our User Guide [2]. For more detailed instructions on updating the trust stores on your client application see our documentation [3].\n\nSecond, update the certificate on all your affected database instances to one of the newly issued CAs. \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 is the default recommended CA because there is no algorithm change. The other CAs use new key algorithms so it could require more testing of your client setup to ensure compatibility. For more information on the new CAs see our documentation [4].\n\nThird, if you want to use a different CA than the default \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019, you will need to set an account level CA override so your new instances will use the CA of your choice. To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later. For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs. \n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 certificate.

To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later. For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs. \n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 certificate. If you wish for new instances to use a different certificate, you can specify which certificate to use with the AWS console or the AWS CLI. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\n3. After August 22, 2024 - \u2018rds-ca-2019\u2019 will expire. You will need to take action before August 22, 2024, to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances.\n\nFor more information see our blog [9], and if you have questions or concerns, please contact AWS Support [10].\n\n[1] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/modify-certificates.html\n[2] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.CertificatesAllRegions\n[3] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation-updating\n[4] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.RegionCertificateAuthorities\n[5] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-certificates.html\n[6] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/create-db-instance.html\n[7] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[8] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[9] https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/rotate-your-ssl-tls-certificates-now-amazon-rds-and-amazon-aurora-expire-in-2024/\n[10] https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home",

For information on setting an account level CA override, see the modify-certificates API documentation [1].\n\nIf your applications connect to these instances using the SSL/TLS protocol, you will need to take action before August 22, 2024 to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances. Even if you do not currently use SSL for your connections, you could still be affected if your databases server certificate expires, so we still recommend updating your CA.\n\nTo protect your communications with your database instances, a CA generates time-bound certificates that are checked by your database client software to authenticate any database instance before exchanging information. Following industry best practices, AWS renews the CA and creates new certificates on a routine basis to ensure customer connections are properly protected for years to come. The current CA in the EU-WEST-1 Region will expire on August 22, 2024. Before this date you will need to update your DB server certificate. The following is the general process to do this:\n\nFirst, update your application clients with the new certificate, if your application client is using a trust store then add the new CA certificates into the trust stores of your client applications. RDS provides download links to the CA certificates in our User Guide [2]. For more detailed instructions on updating the trust stores on your client application see our documentation [3].\n\nSecond, update the certificate on all your affected database instances to one of the newly issued CAs. \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 is the default recommended CA because there is no algorithm change. The other CAs use new key algorithms so it could require more testing of your client setup to ensure compatibility. For more information on the new CAs see our documentation [4].\n\nThird, if you want to use a different CA than the default \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019, you will need to set an account level CA override so your new instances will use the CA of your choice. To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later. For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs. \n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 certificate. If you wish for new instances to use a different certificate, you can specify which certificate to use with the AWS console or the AWS CLI. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\n3. After August 22, 2024 - \u2018rds-ca-2019\u2019 will expire. You will need to take action before August 22, 2024, to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances.\n\nFor more information see our blog [9], and if you have questions or concerns, please contact AWS Support [10].\n\n[1] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/modify-certificates.html\n[2] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.CertificatesAllRegions\n[3] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation-updating\n[4] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.RegionCertificateAuthorities\n[5] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-certificates.html\n[6] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/create-db-instance.html\n[7] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[8] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[9] https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/rotate-your-ssl-tls-certificates-now-amazon-rds-and-amazon-aurora-expire-in-2024/\n[10] https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home",

If you believe you have already finished this work and still received this email, it is likely because you created new instances using the 2019 Certificate Authority (CA). After January 25, 2024 all newly created instances that do not explicitly specify a different CA will use the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 CA. For information on setting an account level CA override, see the modify-certificates API documentation [1].\n\nIf your applications connect to these instances using the SSL/TLS protocol, you will need to take action before August 22, 2024 to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances. Even if you do not currently use SSL for your connections, you could still be affected if your databases server certificate expires, so we still recommend updating your CA.\n\nTo protect your communications with your database instances, a CA generates time-bound certificates that are checked by your database client software to authenticate any database instance before exchanging information. Following industry best practices, AWS renews the CA and creates new certificates on a routine basis to ensure customer connections are properly protected for years to come. The current CA in the EU-WEST-1 Region will expire on August 22, 2024. Before this date you will need to update your DB server certificate. The following is the general process to do this:\n\nFirst, update your application clients with the new certificate, if your application client is using a trust store then add the new CA certificates into the trust stores of your client applications. RDS provides download links to the CA certificates in our User Guide [2]. For more detailed instructions on updating the trust stores on your client application see our documentation [3].\n\nSecond, update the certificate on all your affected database instances to one of the newly issued CAs. \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 is the default recommended CA because there is no algorithm change. The other CAs use new key algorithms so it could require more testing of your client setup to ensure compatibility. For more information on the new CAs see our documentation [4].\n\nThird, if you want to use a different CA than the default \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019, you will need to set an account level CA override so your new instances will use the CA of your choice. To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later. For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs. \n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 certificate. If you wish for new instances to use a different certificate, you can specify which certificate to use with the AWS console or the AWS CLI. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\n3. After August 22, 2024 - \u2018rds-ca-2019\u2019 will expire.

If you believe you have already finished this work and still received this email, it is likely because you created new instances using the 2019 Certificate Authority (CA). After January 25, 2024 all newly created instances that do not explicitly specify a different CA will use the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 CA. For information on setting an account level CA override, see the modify-certificates API documentation [1].\n\nIf your applications connect to these instances using the SSL/TLS protocol, you will need to take action before August 22, 2024 to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances. Even if you do not currently use SSL for your connections, you could still be affected if your databases server certificate expires, so we still recommend updating your CA.\n\nTo protect your communications with your database instances, a CA generates time-bound certificates that are checked by your database client software to authenticate any database instance before exchanging information. Following industry best practices, AWS renews the CA and creates new certificates on a routine basis to ensure customer connections are properly protected for years to come. The current CA in the EU-WEST-1 Region will expire on August 22, 2024. Before this date you will need to update your DB server certificate. The following is the general process to do this:\n\nFirst, update your application clients with the new certificate, if your application client is using a trust store then add the new CA certificates into the trust stores of your client applications. RDS provides download links to the CA certificates in our User Guide [2]. For more detailed instructions on updating the trust stores on your client application see our documentation [3].\n\nSecond, update the certificate on all your affected database instances to one of the newly issued CAs. \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 is the default recommended CA because there is no algorithm change. The other CAs use new key algorithms so it could require more testing of your client setup to ensure compatibility. For more information on the new CAs see our documentation [4].\n\nThird, if you want to use a different CA than the default \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019, you will need to set an account level CA override so your new instances will use the CA of your choice. To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later. For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs. \n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 certificate. If you wish for new instances to use a different certificate, you can specify which certificate to use with the AWS console or the AWS CLI. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\n3. After August 22, 2024 - \u2018rds-ca-2019\u2019 will expire. You will need to take action before August 22, 2024, to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances.\n\nFor more information see our blog [9], and if you have questions or concerns, please contact AWS Support [10].\n\n[1] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/modify-certificates.html\n[2] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.CertificatesAllRegions\n[3] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation-updating\n[4] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.RegionCertificateAuthorities\n[5] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-certificates.html\n[6] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/create-db-instance.html\n[7] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[8] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[9] https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/rotate-your-ssl-tls-certificates-now-amazon-rds-and-amazon-aurora-expire-in-2024/\n[10] https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home",

For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs. \n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 certificate. If you wish for new instances to use a different certificate, you can specify which certificate to use with the AWS console or the AWS CLI. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\n3. After August 22, 2024 - \u2018rds-ca-2019\u2019 will expire. You will need to take action before August 22, 2024, to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances.\n\nFor more information see our blog [9], and if you have questions or concerns, please contact AWS Support [10].\n\n[1] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/modify-certificates.html\n[2] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.CertificatesAllRegions\n[3] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation-updating\n[4] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.RegionCertificateAuthorities\n[5] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-certificates.html\n[6] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/create-db-instance.html\n[7] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[8] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[9] https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/rotate-your-ssl-tls-certificates-now-amazon-rds-and-amazon-aurora-expire-in-2024/\n[10] https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home",

If you believe you have already finished this work and still received this email, it is likely because you created new instances using the 2019 Certificate Authority (CA). After January 25, 2024 all newly created instances that do not explicitly specify a different CA will use the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 CA. For information on setting an account level CA override, see the modify-certificates API documentation [1].\n\nIf your applications connect to these instances using the SSL/TLS protocol, you will need to take action before August 22, 2024 to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances. Even if you do not currently use SSL for your connections, you could still be affected if your databases server certificate expires, so we still recommend updating your CA.\n\nTo protect your communications with your database instances, a CA generates time-bound certificates that are checked by your database client software to authenticate any database instance before exchanging information. Following industry best practices, AWS renews the CA and creates new certificates on a routine basis to ensure customer connections are properly protected for years to come. The current CA in the EU-WEST-1 Region will expire on August 22, 2024. Before this date you will need to update your DB server certificate. The following is the general process to do this:\n\nFirst, update your application clients with the new certificate, if your application client is using a trust store then add the new CA certificates into the trust stores of your client applications. RDS provides download links to the CA certificates in our User Guide [2]. For more detailed instructions on updating the trust stores on your client application see our documentation [3].\n\nSecond, update the certificate on all your affected database instances to one of the newly issued CAs. \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 is the default recommended CA because there is no algorithm change. The other CAs use new key algorithms so it could require more testing of your client setup to ensure compatibility. For more information on the new CAs see our documentation [4].\n\nThird, if you want to use a different CA than the default \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019, you will need to set an account level CA override so your new instances will use the CA of your choice.

Following industry best practices, AWS renews the CA and creates new certificates on a routine basis to ensure customer connections are properly protected for years to come. The current CA in the EU-WEST-1 Region will expire on August 22, 2024. Before this date you will need to update your DB server certificate. The following is the general process to do this:\n\nFirst, update your application clients with the new certificate, if your application client is using a trust store then add the new CA certificates into the trust stores of your client applications. RDS provides download links to the CA certificates in our User Guide [2]. For more detailed instructions on updating the trust stores on your client application see our documentation [3].\n\nSecond, update the certificate on all your affected database instances to one of the newly issued CAs. \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 is the default recommended CA because there is no algorithm change. The other CAs use new key algorithms so it could require more testing of your client setup to ensure compatibility. For more information on the new CAs see our documentation [4].\n\nThird, if you want to use a different CA than the default \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019, you will need to set an account level CA override so your new instances will use the CA of your choice. To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later. For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs. \n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 certificate. If you wish for new instances to use a different certificate, you can specify which certificate to use with the AWS console or the AWS CLI. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\n3. After August 22, 2024 - \u2018rds-ca-2019\u2019 will expire. You will need to take action before August 22, 2024, to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances.\n\nFor more information see our blog [9], and if you have questions or concerns, please contact AWS Support [10].\n\n[1] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/modify-certificates.html\n[2] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.CertificatesAllRegions\n[3] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation-updating\n[4] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.RegionCertificateAuthorities\n[5] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-certificates.html\n[6] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/create-db-instance.html\n[7] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[8] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[9] https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/rotate-your-ssl-tls-certificates-now-amazon-rds-and-amazon-aurora-expire-in-2024/\n[10] https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home",

If you believe you have already finished this work and still received this email, it is likely because you created new instances using the 2019 Certificate Authority (CA). After January 25, 2024 all newly created instances that do not explicitly specify a different CA will use the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 CA. For information on setting an account level CA override, see the modify-certificates API documentation [1].\n\nIf your applications connect to these instances using the SSL/TLS protocol, you will need to take action before August 22, 2024 to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances. Even if you do not currently use SSL for your connections, you could still be affected if your databases server certificate expires, so we still recommend updating your CA.\n\nTo protect your communications with your database instances, a CA generates time-bound certificates that are checked by your database client software to authenticate any database instance before exchanging information. Following industry best practices, AWS renews the CA and creates new certificates on a routine basis to ensure customer connections are properly protected for years to come. The current CA in the EU-WEST-1 Region will expire on August 22, 2024. Before this date you will need to update your DB server certificate. The following is the general process to do this:\n\nFirst, update your application clients with the new certificate, if your application client is using a trust store then add the new CA certificates into the trust stores of your client applications. RDS provides download links to the CA certificates in our User Guide [2]. For more detailed instructions on updating the trust stores on your client application see our documentation [3].\n\nSecond, update the certificate on all your affected database instances to one of the newly issued CAs. \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 is the default recommended CA because there is no algorithm change. The other CAs use new key algorithms so it could require more testing of your client setup to ensure compatibility. For more information on the new CAs see our documentation [4].\n\nThird, if you want to use a different CA than the default \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019, you will need to set an account level CA override so your new instances will use the CA of your choice. To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later. For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs. \n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 certificate. If you wish for new instances to use a different certificate, you can specify which certificate to use with the AWS console or the AWS CLI. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\n3. After August 22, 2024 - \u2018rds-ca-2019\u2019 will expire.

If you believe you have already finished this work and still received this email, it is likely because you created new instances using the 2019 Certificate Authority (CA). After January 25, 2024 all newly created instances that do not explicitly specify a different CA will use the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 CA. For information on setting an account level CA override, see the modify-certificates API documentation [1].\n\nIf your applications connect to these instances using the SSL/TLS protocol, you will need to take action before August 22, 2024 to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances. Even if you do not currently use SSL for your connections, you could still be affected if your databases server certificate expires, so we still recommend updating your CA.\n\nTo protect your communications with your database instances, a CA generates time-bound certificates that are checked by your database client software to authenticate any database instance before exchanging information. Following industry best practices, AWS renews the CA and creates new certificates on a routine basis to ensure customer connections are properly protected for years to come. The current CA in the EU-WEST-1 Region will expire on August 22, 2024. Before this date you will need to update your DB server certificate. The following is the general process to do this:\n\nFirst, update your application clients with the new certificate, if your application client is using a trust store then add the new CA certificates into the trust stores of your client applications. RDS provides download links to the CA certificates in our User Guide [2]. For more detailed instructions on updating the trust stores on your client application see our documentation [3].\n\nSecond, update the certificate on all your affected database instances to one of the newly issued CAs. \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 is the default recommended CA because there is no algorithm change. The other CAs use new key algorithms so it could require more testing of your client setup to ensure compatibility. For more information on the new CAs see our documentation [4].\n\nThird, if you want to use a different CA than the default \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019, you will need to set an account level CA override so your new instances will use the CA of your choice. To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later. For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs. \n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 certificate. If you wish for new instances to use a different certificate, you can specify which certificate to use with the AWS console or the AWS CLI. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\n3. After August 22, 2024 - \u2018rds-ca-2019\u2019 will expire.

If you believe you have already finished this work and still received this email, it is likely because you created new instances using the 2019 Certificate Authority (CA). After January 25, 2024 all newly created instances that do not explicitly specify a different CA will use the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 CA. For information on setting an account level CA override, see the modify-certificates API documentation [1].\n\nIf your applications connect to these instances using the SSL/TLS protocol, you will need to take action before August 22, 2024 to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances. Even if you do not currently use SSL for your connections, you could still be affected if your databases server certificate expires, so we still recommend updating your CA.\n\nTo protect your communications with your database instances, a CA generates time-bound certificates that are checked by your database client software to authenticate any database instance before exchanging information. Following industry best practices, AWS renews the CA and creates new certificates on a routine basis to ensure customer connections are properly protected for years to come. The current CA in the EU-WEST-1 Region will expire on August 22, 2024. Before this date you will need to update your DB server certificate. The following is the general process to do this:\n\nFirst, update your application clients with the new certificate, if your application client is using a trust store then add the new CA certificates into the trust stores of your client applications. RDS provides download links to the CA certificates in our User Guide [2]. For more detailed instructions on updating the trust stores on your client application see our documentation [3].\n\nSecond, update the certificate on all your affected database instances to one of the newly issued CAs. \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 is the default recommended CA because there is no algorithm change. The other CAs use new key algorithms so it could require more testing of your client setup to ensure compatibility. For more information on the new CAs see our documentation [4].\n\nThird, if you want to use a different CA than the default \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019, you will need to set an account level CA override so your new instances will use the CA of your choice. To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later. For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs. \n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 certificate.

To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later. For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs. \n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 certificate. If you wish for new instances to use a different certificate, you can specify which certificate to use with the AWS console or the AWS CLI. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\n3. After August 22, 2024 - \u2018rds-ca-2019\u2019 will expire. You will need to take action before August 22, 2024, to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances.\n\nFor more information see our blog [9], and if you have questions or concerns, please contact AWS Support [10].\n\n[1] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/modify-certificates.html\n[2] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.CertificatesAllRegions\n[3] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation-updating\n[4] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.RegionCertificateAuthorities\n[5] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-certificates.html\n[6] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/create-db-instance.html\n[7] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[8] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[9] https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/rotate-your-ssl-tls-certificates-now-amazon-rds-and-amazon-aurora-expire-in-2024/\n[10] https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home",

For information on setting an account level CA override, see the modify-certificates API documentation [1].\n\nIf your applications connect to these instances using the SSL/TLS protocol, you will need to take action before August 22, 2024 to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances. Even if you do not currently use SSL for your connections, you could still be affected if your databases server certificate expires, so we still recommend updating your CA.\n\nTo protect your communications with your database instances, a CA generates time-bound certificates that are checked by your database client software to authenticate any database instance before exchanging information. Following industry best practices, AWS renews the CA and creates new certificates on a routine basis to ensure customer connections are properly protected for years to come. The current CA in the EU-WEST-1 Region will expire on August 22, 2024. Before this date you will need to update your DB server certificate. The following is the general process to do this:\n\nFirst, update your application clients with the new certificate, if your application client is using a trust store then add the new CA certificates into the trust stores of your client applications. RDS provides download links to the CA certificates in our User Guide [2]. For more detailed instructions on updating the trust stores on your client application see our documentation [3].\n\nSecond, update the certificate on all your affected database instances to one of the newly issued CAs. \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 is the default recommended CA because there is no algorithm change. The other CAs use new key algorithms so it could require more testing of your client setup to ensure compatibility. For more information on the new CAs see our documentation [4].\n\nThird, if you want to use a different CA than the default \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019, you will need to set an account level CA override so your new instances will use the CA of your choice. To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later. For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs. \n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 certificate. If you wish for new instances to use a different certificate, you can specify which certificate to use with the AWS console or the AWS CLI. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\n3. After August 22, 2024 - \u2018rds-ca-2019\u2019 will expire. You will need to take action before August 22, 2024, to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances.\n\nFor more information see our blog [9], and if you have questions or concerns, please contact AWS Support [10].\n\n[1] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/modify-certificates.html\n[2] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.CertificatesAllRegions\n[3] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation-updating\n[4] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.RegionCertificateAuthorities\n[5] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-certificates.html\n[6] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/create-db-instance.html\n[7] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[8] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[9] https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/rotate-your-ssl-tls-certificates-now-amazon-rds-and-amazon-aurora-expire-in-2024/\n[10] https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home",

If you believe you have already finished this work and still received this email, it is likely because you created new instances using the 2019 Certificate Authority (CA). After January 25, 2024 all newly created instances that do not explicitly specify a different CA will use the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 CA. For information on setting an account level CA override, see the modify-certificates API documentation [1].\n\nIf your applications connect to these instances using the SSL/TLS protocol, you will need to take action before August 22, 2024 to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances. Even if you do not currently use SSL for your connections, you could still be affected if your databases server certificate expires, so we still recommend updating your CA.\n\nTo protect your communications with your database instances, a CA generates time-bound certificates that are checked by your database client software to authenticate any database instance before exchanging information. Following industry best practices, AWS renews the CA and creates new certificates on a routine basis to ensure customer connections are properly protected for years to come. The current CA in the EU-WEST-1 Region will expire on August 22, 2024. Before this date you will need to update your DB server certificate. The following is the general process to do this:\n\nFirst, update your application clients with the new certificate, if your application client is using a trust store then add the new CA certificates into the trust stores of your client applications. RDS provides download links to the CA certificates in our User Guide [2]. For more detailed instructions on updating the trust stores on your client application see our documentation [3].\n\nSecond, update the certificate on all your affected database instances to one of the newly issued CAs. \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 is the default recommended CA because there is no algorithm change. The other CAs use new key algorithms so it could require more testing of your client setup to ensure compatibility. For more information on the new CAs see our documentation [4].\n\nThird, if you want to use a different CA than the default \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019, you will need to set an account level CA override so your new instances will use the CA of your choice. To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later. For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs. \n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 certificate. If you wish for new instances to use a different certificate, you can specify which certificate to use with the AWS console or the AWS CLI. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\n3. After August 22, 2024 - \u2018rds-ca-2019\u2019 will expire.

If you believe you have already finished this work and still received this email, it is likely because you created new instances using the 2019 Certificate Authority (CA). After January 25, 2024 all newly created instances that do not explicitly specify a different CA will use the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 CA. For information on setting an account level CA override, see the modify-certificates API documentation [1].\n\nIf your applications connect to these instances using the SSL/TLS protocol, you will need to take action before August 22, 2024 to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances. Even if you do not currently use SSL for your connections, you could still be affected if your databases server certificate expires, so we still recommend updating your CA.\n\nTo protect your communications with your database instances, a CA generates time-bound certificates that are checked by your database client software to authenticate any database instance before exchanging information. Following industry best practices, AWS renews the CA and creates new certificates on a routine basis to ensure customer connections are properly protected for years to come. The current CA in the EU-WEST-1 Region will expire on August 22, 2024. Before this date you will need to update your DB server certificate. The following is the general process to do this:\n\nFirst, update your application clients with the new certificate, if your application client is using a trust store then add the new CA certificates into the trust stores of your client applications. RDS provides download links to the CA certificates in our User Guide [2]. For more detailed instructions on updating the trust stores on your client application see our documentation [3].\n\nSecond, update the certificate on all your affected database instances to one of the newly issued CAs. \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 is the default recommended CA because there is no algorithm change. The other CAs use new key algorithms so it could require more testing of your client setup to ensure compatibility. For more information on the new CAs see our documentation [4].\n\nThird, if you want to use a different CA than the default \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019, you will need to set an account level CA override so your new instances will use the CA of your choice. To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later. For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs. \n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 certificate. If you wish for new instances to use a different certificate, you can specify which certificate to use with the AWS console or the AWS CLI. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\n3. After August 22, 2024 - \u2018rds-ca-2019\u2019 will expire. You will need to take action before August 22, 2024, to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances.\n\nFor more information see our blog [9], and if you have questions or concerns, please contact AWS Support [10].\n\n[1] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/modify-certificates.html\n[2] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.CertificatesAllRegions\n[3] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation-updating\n[4] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.RegionCertificateAuthorities\n[5] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-certificates.html\n[6] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/create-db-instance.html\n[7] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[8] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[9] https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/rotate-your-ssl-tls-certificates-now-amazon-rds-and-amazon-aurora-expire-in-2024/\n[10] https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home",

For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs. \n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 certificate. If you wish for new instances to use a different certificate, you can specify which certificate to use with the AWS console or the AWS CLI. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\n3. After August 22, 2024 - \u2018rds-ca-2019\u2019 will expire. You will need to take action before August 22, 2024, to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances.\n\nFor more information see our blog [9], and if you have questions or concerns, please contact AWS Support [10].\n\n[1] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/modify-certificates.html\n[2] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.CertificatesAllRegions\n[3] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation-updating\n[4] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.RegionCertificateAuthorities\n[5] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-certificates.html\n[6] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/create-db-instance.html\n[7] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[8] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[9] https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/rotate-your-ssl-tls-certificates-now-amazon-rds-and-amazon-aurora-expire-in-2024/\n[10] https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home",

If you believe you have already finished this work and still received this email, it is likely because you created new instances using the 2019 Certificate Authority (CA). After January 25, 2024 all newly created instances that do not explicitly specify a different CA will use the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 CA. For information on setting an account level CA override, see the modify-certificates API documentation [1].\n\nIf your applications connect to these instances using the SSL/TLS protocol, you will need to take action before August 22, 2024 to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances. Even if you do not currently use SSL for your connections, you could still be affected if your databases server certificate expires, so we still recommend updating your CA.\n\nTo protect your communications with your database instances, a CA generates time-bound certificates that are checked by your database client software to authenticate any database instance before exchanging information. Following industry best practices, AWS renews the CA and creates new certificates on a routine basis to ensure customer connections are properly protected for years to come. The current CA in the EU-WEST-1 Region will expire on August 22, 2024. Before this date you will need to update your DB server certificate. The following is the general process to do this:\n\nFirst, update your application clients with the new certificate, if your application client is using a trust store then add the new CA certificates into the trust stores of your client applications. RDS provides download links to the CA certificates in our User Guide [2]. For more detailed instructions on updating the trust stores on your client application see our documentation [3].\n\nSecond, update the certificate on all your affected database instances to one of the newly issued CAs. \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 is the default recommended CA because there is no algorithm change. The other CAs use new key algorithms so it could require more testing of your client setup to ensure compatibility. For more information on the new CAs see our documentation [4].\n\nThird, if you want to use a different CA than the default \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019, you will need to set an account level CA override so your new instances will use the CA of your choice.

Following industry best practices, AWS renews the CA and creates new certificates on a routine basis to ensure customer connections are properly protected for years to come. The current CA in the EU-WEST-1 Region will expire on August 22, 2024. Before this date you will need to update your DB server certificate. The following is the general process to do this:\n\nFirst, update your application clients with the new certificate, if your application client is using a trust store then add the new CA certificates into the trust stores of your client applications. RDS provides download links to the CA certificates in our User Guide [2]. For more detailed instructions on updating the trust stores on your client application see our documentation [3].\n\nSecond, update the certificate on all your affected database instances to one of the newly issued CAs. \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 is the default recommended CA because there is no algorithm change. The other CAs use new key algorithms so it could require more testing of your client setup to ensure compatibility. For more information on the new CAs see our documentation [4].\n\nThird, if you want to use a different CA than the default \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019, you will need to set an account level CA override so your new instances will use the CA of your choice. To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later. For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs. \n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 certificate. If you wish for new instances to use a different certificate, you can specify which certificate to use with the AWS console or the AWS CLI. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\n3. After August 22, 2024 - \u2018rds-ca-2019\u2019 will expire. You will need to take action before August 22, 2024, to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances.\n\nFor more information see our blog [9], and if you have questions or concerns, please contact AWS Support [10].\n\n[1] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/modify-certificates.html\n[2] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.CertificatesAllRegions\n[3] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation-updating\n[4] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.RegionCertificateAuthorities\n[5] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-certificates.html\n[6] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/create-db-instance.html\n[7] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[8] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[9] https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/rotate-your-ssl-tls-certificates-now-amazon-rds-and-amazon-aurora-expire-in-2024/\n[10] https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home",

If you believe you have already finished this work and still received this email, it is likely because you created new instances using the 2019 Certificate Authority (CA). After January 25, 2024 all newly created instances that do not explicitly specify a different CA will use the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 CA. For information on setting an account level CA override, see the modify-certificates API documentation [1].\n\nIf your applications connect to these instances using the SSL/TLS protocol, you will need to take action before August 22, 2024 to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances. Even if you do not currently use SSL for your connections, you could still be affected if your databases server certificate expires, so we still recommend updating your CA.\n\nTo protect your communications with your database instances, a CA generates time-bound certificates that are checked by your database client software to authenticate any database instance before exchanging information. Following industry best practices, AWS renews the CA and creates new certificates on a routine basis to ensure customer connections are properly protected for years to come. The current CA in the EU-WEST-1 Region will expire on August 22, 2024. Before this date you will need to update your DB server certificate. The following is the general process to do this:\n\nFirst, update your application clients with the new certificate, if your application client is using a trust store then add the new CA certificates into the trust stores of your client applications. RDS provides download links to the CA certificates in our User Guide [2]. For more detailed instructions on updating the trust stores on your client application see our documentation [3].\n\nSecond, update the certificate on all your affected database instances to one of the newly issued CAs. \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 is the default recommended CA because there is no algorithm change. The other CAs use new key algorithms so it could require more testing of your client setup to ensure compatibility. For more information on the new CAs see our documentation [4].\n\nThird, if you want to use a different CA than the default \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019, you will need to set an account level CA override so your new instances will use the CA of your choice. To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later. For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs. \n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 certificate. If you wish for new instances to use a different certificate, you can specify which certificate to use with the AWS console or the AWS CLI. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\n3. After August 22, 2024 - \u2018rds-ca-2019\u2019 will expire.

If you believe you have already finished this work and still received this email, it is likely because you created new instances using the 2019 Certificate Authority (CA). After January 25, 2024 all newly created instances that do not explicitly specify a different CA will use the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 CA. For information on setting an account level CA override, see the modify-certificates API documentation [1].\n\nIf your applications connect to these instances using the SSL/TLS protocol, you will need to take action before August 22, 2024 to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances. Even if you do not currently use SSL for your connections, you could still be affected if your databases server certificate expires, so we still recommend updating your CA.\n\nTo protect your communications with your database instances, a CA generates time-bound certificates that are checked by your database client software to authenticate any database instance before exchanging information. Following industry best practices, AWS renews the CA and creates new certificates on a routine basis to ensure customer connections are properly protected for years to come. The current CA in the EU-WEST-1 Region will expire on August 22, 2024. Before this date you will need to update your DB server certificate. The following is the general process to do this:\n\nFirst, update your application clients with the new certificate, if your application client is using a trust store then add the new CA certificates into the trust stores of your client applications. RDS provides download links to the CA certificates in our User Guide [2]. For more detailed instructions on updating the trust stores on your client application see our documentation [3].\n\nSecond, update the certificate on all your affected database instances to one of the newly issued CAs. \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 is the default recommended CA because there is no algorithm change. The other CAs use new key algorithms so it could require more testing of your client setup to ensure compatibility. For more information on the new CAs see our documentation [4].\n\nThird, if you want to use a different CA than the default \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019, you will need to set an account level CA override so your new instances will use the CA of your choice. To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later. For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs. \n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 certificate. If you wish for new instances to use a different certificate, you can specify which certificate to use with the AWS console or the AWS CLI. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\n3. After August 22, 2024 - \u2018rds-ca-2019\u2019 will expire.

If you believe you have already finished this work and still received this email, it is likely because you created new instances using the 2019 Certificate Authority (CA). After January 25, 2024 all newly created instances that do not explicitly specify a different CA will use the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 CA. For information on setting an account level CA override, see the modify-certificates API documentation [1].\n\nIf your applications connect to these instances using the SSL/TLS protocol, you will need to take action before August 22, 2024 to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances. Even if you do not currently use SSL for your connections, you could still be affected if your databases server certificate expires, so we still recommend updating your CA.\n\nTo protect your communications with your database instances, a CA generates time-bound certificates that are checked by your database client software to authenticate any database instance before exchanging information. Following industry best practices, AWS renews the CA and creates new certificates on a routine basis to ensure customer connections are properly protected for years to come. The current CA in the EU-WEST-1 Region will expire on August 22, 2024. Before this date you will need to update your DB server certificate. The following is the general process to do this:\n\nFirst, update your application clients with the new certificate, if your application client is using a trust store then add the new CA certificates into the trust stores of your client applications. RDS provides download links to the CA certificates in our User Guide [2]. For more detailed instructions on updating the trust stores on your client application see our documentation [3].\n\nSecond, update the certificate on all your affected database instances to one of the newly issued CAs. \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 is the default recommended CA because there is no algorithm change. The other CAs use new key algorithms so it could require more testing of your client setup to ensure compatibility. For more information on the new CAs see our documentation [4].\n\nThird, if you want to use a different CA than the default \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019, you will need to set an account level CA override so your new instances will use the CA of your choice. To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later. For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs. \n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 certificate.

To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later. For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs. \n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 certificate. If you wish for new instances to use a different certificate, you can specify which certificate to use with the AWS console or the AWS CLI. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\n3. After August 22, 2024 - \u2018rds-ca-2019\u2019 will expire. You will need to take action before August 22, 2024, to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances.\n\nFor more information see our blog [9], and if you have questions or concerns, please contact AWS Support [10].\n\n[1] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/modify-certificates.html\n[2] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.CertificatesAllRegions\n[3] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation-updating\n[4] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.RegionCertificateAuthorities\n[5] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-certificates.html\n[6] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/create-db-instance.html\n[7] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[8] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[9] https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/rotate-your-ssl-tls-certificates-now-amazon-rds-and-amazon-aurora-expire-in-2024/\n[10] https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home",

For information on setting an account level CA override, see the modify-certificates API documentation [1].\n\nIf your applications connect to these instances using the SSL/TLS protocol, you will need to take action before August 22, 2024 to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances. Even if you do not currently use SSL for your connections, you could still be affected if your databases server certificate expires, so we still recommend updating your CA.\n\nTo protect your communications with your database instances, a CA generates time-bound certificates that are checked by your database client software to authenticate any database instance before exchanging information. Following industry best practices, AWS renews the CA and creates new certificates on a routine basis to ensure customer connections are properly protected for years to come. The current CA in the EU-WEST-1 Region will expire on August 22, 2024. Before this date you will need to update your DB server certificate. The following is the general process to do this:\n\nFirst, update your application clients with the new certificate, if your application client is using a trust store then add the new CA certificates into the trust stores of your client applications. RDS provides download links to the CA certificates in our User Guide [2]. For more detailed instructions on updating the trust stores on your client application see our documentation [3].\n\nSecond, update the certificate on all your affected database instances to one of the newly issued CAs. \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 is the default recommended CA because there is no algorithm change. The other CAs use new key algorithms so it could require more testing of your client setup to ensure compatibility. For more information on the new CAs see our documentation [4].\n\nThird, if you want to use a different CA than the default \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019, you will need to set an account level CA override so your new instances will use the CA of your choice. To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later. For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs. \n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 certificate. If you wish for new instances to use a different certificate, you can specify which certificate to use with the AWS console or the AWS CLI. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\n3. After August 22, 2024 - \u2018rds-ca-2019\u2019 will expire. You will need to take action before August 22, 2024, to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances.\n\nFor more information see our blog [9], and if you have questions or concerns, please contact AWS Support [10].\n\n[1] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/modify-certificates.html\n[2] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.CertificatesAllRegions\n[3] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation-updating\n[4] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.RegionCertificateAuthorities\n[5] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-certificates.html\n[6] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/create-db-instance.html\n[7] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[8] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[9] https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/rotate-your-ssl-tls-certificates-now-amazon-rds-and-amazon-aurora-expire-in-2024/\n[10] https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home",

If you believe you have already finished this work and still received this email, it is likely because you created new instances using the 2019 Certificate Authority (CA). After January 25, 2024 all newly created instances that do not explicitly specify a different CA will use the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 CA. For information on setting an account level CA override, see the modify-certificates API documentation [1].\n\nIf your applications connect to these instances using the SSL/TLS protocol, you will need to take action before August 22, 2024 to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances. Even if you do not currently use SSL for your connections, you could still be affected if your databases server certificate expires, so we still recommend updating your CA.\n\nTo protect your communications with your database instances, a CA generates time-bound certificates that are checked by your database client software to authenticate any database instance before exchanging information. Following industry best practices, AWS renews the CA and creates new certificates on a routine basis to ensure customer connections are properly protected for years to come. The current CA in the EU-WEST-1 Region will expire on August 22, 2024. Before this date you will need to update your DB server certificate. The following is the general process to do this:\n\nFirst, update your application clients with the new certificate, if your application client is using a trust store then add the new CA certificates into the trust stores of your client applications. RDS provides download links to the CA certificates in our User Guide [2]. For more detailed instructions on updating the trust stores on your client application see our documentation [3].\n\nSecond, update the certificate on all your affected database instances to one of the newly issued CAs. \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 is the default recommended CA because there is no algorithm change. The other CAs use new key algorithms so it could require more testing of your client setup to ensure compatibility. For more information on the new CAs see our documentation [4].\n\nThird, if you want to use a different CA than the default \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019, you will need to set an account level CA override so your new instances will use the CA of your choice. To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later. For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs. \n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 certificate. If you wish for new instances to use a different certificate, you can specify which certificate to use with the AWS console or the AWS CLI. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\n3. After August 22, 2024 - \u2018rds-ca-2019\u2019 will expire.

If you believe you have already finished this work and still received this email, it is likely because you created new instances using the 2019 Certificate Authority (CA). After January 25, 2024 all newly created instances that do not explicitly specify a different CA will use the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 CA. For information on setting an account level CA override, see the modify-certificates API documentation [1].\n\nIf your applications connect to these instances using the SSL/TLS protocol, you will need to take action before August 22, 2024 to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances. Even if you do not currently use SSL for your connections, you could still be affected if your databases server certificate expires, so we still recommend updating your CA.\n\nTo protect your communications with your database instances, a CA generates time-bound certificates that are checked by your database client software to authenticate any database instance before exchanging information. Following industry best practices, AWS renews the CA and creates new certificates on a routine basis to ensure customer connections are properly protected for years to come. The current CA in the EU-WEST-1 Region will expire on August 22, 2024. Before this date you will need to update your DB server certificate. The following is the general process to do this:\n\nFirst, update your application clients with the new certificate, if your application client is using a trust store then add the new CA certificates into the trust stores of your client applications. RDS provides download links to the CA certificates in our User Guide [2]. For more detailed instructions on updating the trust stores on your client application see our documentation [3].\n\nSecond, update the certificate on all your affected database instances to one of the newly issued CAs. \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 is the default recommended CA because there is no algorithm change. The other CAs use new key algorithms so it could require more testing of your client setup to ensure compatibility. For more information on the new CAs see our documentation [4].\n\nThird, if you want to use a different CA than the default \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019, you will need to set an account level CA override so your new instances will use the CA of your choice. To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later. For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs. \n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 certificate. If you wish for new instances to use a different certificate, you can specify which certificate to use with the AWS console or the AWS CLI. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\n3. After August 22, 2024 - \u2018rds-ca-2019\u2019 will expire. You will need to take action before August 22, 2024, to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances.\n\nFor more information see our blog [9], and if you have questions or concerns, please contact AWS Support [10].\n\n[1] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/modify-certificates.html\n[2] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.CertificatesAllRegions\n[3] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation-updating\n[4] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.RegionCertificateAuthorities\n[5] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-certificates.html\n[6] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/create-db-instance.html\n[7] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[8] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[9] https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/rotate-your-ssl-tls-certificates-now-amazon-rds-and-amazon-aurora-expire-in-2024/\n[10] https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home",

For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs. \n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 certificate. If you wish for new instances to use a different certificate, you can specify which certificate to use with the AWS console or the AWS CLI. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\n3. After August 22, 2024 - \u2018rds-ca-2019\u2019 will expire. You will need to take action before August 22, 2024, to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances.\n\nFor more information see our blog [9], and if you have questions or concerns, please contact AWS Support [10].\n\n[1] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/modify-certificates.html\n[2] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.CertificatesAllRegions\n[3] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation-updating\n[4] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.RegionCertificateAuthorities\n[5] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-certificates.html\n[6] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/create-db-instance.html\n[7] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[8] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[9] https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/rotate-your-ssl-tls-certificates-now-amazon-rds-and-amazon-aurora-expire-in-2024/\n[10] https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home",

If you believe you have already finished this work and still received this email, it is likely because you created new instances using the 2019 Certificate Authority (CA). After January 25, 2024 all newly created instances that do not explicitly specify a different CA will use the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 CA. For information on setting an account level CA override, see the modify-certificates API documentation [1].\n\nIf your applications connect to these instances using the SSL/TLS protocol, you will need to take action before August 22, 2024 to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances. Even if you do not currently use SSL for your connections, you could still be affected if your databases server certificate expires, so we still recommend updating your CA.\n\nTo protect your communications with your database instances, a CA generates time-bound certificates that are checked by your database client software to authenticate any database instance before exchanging information. Following industry best practices, AWS renews the CA and creates new certificates on a routine basis to ensure customer connections are properly protected for years to come. The current CA in the EU-WEST-1 Region will expire on August 22, 2024. Before this date you will need to update your DB server certificate. The following is the general process to do this:\n\nFirst, update your application clients with the new certificate, if your application client is using a trust store then add the new CA certificates into the trust stores of your client applications. RDS provides download links to the CA certificates in our User Guide [2]. For more detailed instructions on updating the trust stores on your client application see our documentation [3].\n\nSecond, update the certificate on all your affected database instances to one of the newly issued CAs. \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 is the default recommended CA because there is no algorithm change. The other CAs use new key algorithms so it could require more testing of your client setup to ensure compatibility. For more information on the new CAs see our documentation [4].\n\nThird, if you want to use a different CA than the default \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019, you will need to set an account level CA override so your new instances will use the CA of your choice.

Following industry best practices, AWS renews the CA and creates new certificates on a routine basis to ensure customer connections are properly protected for years to come. The current CA in the EU-WEST-1 Region will expire on August 22, 2024. Before this date you will need to update your DB server certificate. The following is the general process to do this:\n\nFirst, update your application clients with the new certificate, if your application client is using a trust store then add the new CA certificates into the trust stores of your client applications. RDS provides download links to the CA certificates in our User Guide [2]. For more detailed instructions on updating the trust stores on your client application see our documentation [3].\n\nSecond, update the certificate on all your affected database instances to one of the newly issued CAs. \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 is the default recommended CA because there is no algorithm change. The other CAs use new key algorithms so it could require more testing of your client setup to ensure compatibility. For more information on the new CAs see our documentation [4].\n\nThird, if you want to use a different CA than the default \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019, you will need to set an account level CA override so your new instances will use the CA of your choice. To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later. For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs. \n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 certificate. If you wish for new instances to use a different certificate, you can specify which certificate to use with the AWS console or the AWS CLI. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\n3. After August 22, 2024 - \u2018rds-ca-2019\u2019 will expire. You will need to take action before August 22, 2024, to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances.\n\nFor more information see our blog [9], and if you have questions or concerns, please contact AWS Support [10].\n\n[1] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/modify-certificates.html\n[2] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.CertificatesAllRegions\n[3] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation-updating\n[4] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.RegionCertificateAuthorities\n[5] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-certificates.html\n[6] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/create-db-instance.html\n[7] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[8] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[9] https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/rotate-your-ssl-tls-certificates-now-amazon-rds-and-amazon-aurora-expire-in-2024/\n[10] https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home",

If you believe you have already finished this work and still received this email, it is likely because you created new instances using the 2019 Certificate Authority (CA). After January 25, 2024 all newly created instances that do not explicitly specify a different CA will use the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 CA. For information on setting an account level CA override, see the modify-certificates API documentation [1].\n\nIf your applications connect to these instances using the SSL/TLS protocol, you will need to take action before August 22, 2024 to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances. Even if you do not currently use SSL for your connections, you could still be affected if your databases server certificate expires, so we still recommend updating your CA.\n\nTo protect your communications with your database instances, a CA generates time-bound certificates that are checked by your database client software to authenticate any database instance before exchanging information. Following industry best practices, AWS renews the CA and creates new certificates on a routine basis to ensure customer connections are properly protected for years to come. The current CA in the EU-WEST-1 Region will expire on August 22, 2024. Before this date you will need to update your DB server certificate. The following is the general process to do this:\n\nFirst, update your application clients with the new certificate, if your application client is using a trust store then add the new CA certificates into the trust stores of your client applications. RDS provides download links to the CA certificates in our User Guide [2]. For more detailed instructions on updating the trust stores on your client application see our documentation [3].\n\nSecond, update the certificate on all your affected database instances to one of the newly issued CAs. \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 is the default recommended CA because there is no algorithm change. The other CAs use new key algorithms so it could require more testing of your client setup to ensure compatibility. For more information on the new CAs see our documentation [4].\n\nThird, if you want to use a different CA than the default \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019, you will need to set an account level CA override so your new instances will use the CA of your choice. To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later. For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs. \n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 certificate. If you wish for new instances to use a different certificate, you can specify which certificate to use with the AWS console or the AWS CLI. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\n3. After August 22, 2024 - \u2018rds-ca-2019\u2019 will expire.

If you believe you have already finished this work and still received this email, it is likely because you created new instances using the 2019 Certificate Authority (CA). After January 25, 2024 all newly created instances that do not explicitly specify a different CA will use the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 CA. For information on setting an account level CA override, see the modify-certificates API documentation [1].\n\nIf your applications connect to these instances using the SSL/TLS protocol, you will need to take action before August 22, 2024 to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances. Even if you do not currently use SSL for your connections, you could still be affected if your databases server certificate expires, so we still recommend updating your CA.\n\nTo protect your communications with your database instances, a CA generates time-bound certificates that are checked by your database client software to authenticate any database instance before exchanging information. Following industry best practices, AWS renews the CA and creates new certificates on a routine basis to ensure customer connections are properly protected for years to come. The current CA in the EU-WEST-1 Region will expire on August 22, 2024. Before this date you will need to update your DB server certificate. The following is the general process to do this:\n\nFirst, update your application clients with the new certificate, if your application client is using a trust store then add the new CA certificates into the trust stores of your client applications. RDS provides download links to the CA certificates in our User Guide [2]. For more detailed instructions on updating the trust stores on your client application see our documentation [3].\n\nSecond, update the certificate on all your affected database instances to one of the newly issued CAs. \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 is the default recommended CA because there is no algorithm change. The other CAs use new key algorithms so it could require more testing of your client setup to ensure compatibility. For more information on the new CAs see our documentation [4].\n\nThird, if you want to use a different CA than the default \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019, you will need to set an account level CA override so your new instances will use the CA of your choice. To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later. For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs. \n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 certificate. If you wish for new instances to use a different certificate, you can specify which certificate to use with the AWS console or the AWS CLI. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\n3. After August 22, 2024 - \u2018rds-ca-2019\u2019 will expire.

If you believe you have already finished this work and still received this email, it is likely because you created new instances using the 2019 Certificate Authority (CA). After January 25, 2024 all newly created instances that do not explicitly specify a different CA will use the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 CA. For information on setting an account level CA override, see the modify-certificates API documentation [1].\n\nIf your applications connect to these instances using the SSL/TLS protocol, you will need to take action before August 22, 2024 to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances. Even if you do not currently use SSL for your connections, you could still be affected if your databases server certificate expires, so we still recommend updating your CA.\n\nTo protect your communications with your database instances, a CA generates time-bound certificates that are checked by your database client software to authenticate any database instance before exchanging information. Following industry best practices, AWS renews the CA and creates new certificates on a routine basis to ensure customer connections are properly protected for years to come. The current CA in the EU-WEST-1 Region will expire on August 22, 2024. Before this date you will need to update your DB server certificate. The following is the general process to do this:\n\nFirst, update your application clients with the new certificate, if your application client is using a trust store then add the new CA certificates into the trust stores of your client applications. RDS provides download links to the CA certificates in our User Guide [2]. For more detailed instructions on updating the trust stores on your client application see our documentation [3].\n\nSecond, update the certificate on all your affected database instances to one of the newly issued CAs. \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 is the default recommended CA because there is no algorithm change. The other CAs use new key algorithms so it could require more testing of your client setup to ensure compatibility. For more information on the new CAs see our documentation [4].\n\nThird, if you want to use a different CA than the default \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019, you will need to set an account level CA override so your new instances will use the CA of your choice. To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later. For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs. \n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 certificate.

To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later. For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs. \n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 certificate. If you wish for new instances to use a different certificate, you can specify which certificate to use with the AWS console or the AWS CLI. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\n3. After August 22, 2024 - \u2018rds-ca-2019\u2019 will expire. You will need to take action before August 22, 2024, to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances.\n\nFor more information see our blog [9], and if you have questions or concerns, please contact AWS Support [10].\n\n[1] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/modify-certificates.html\n[2] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.CertificatesAllRegions\n[3] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation-updating\n[4] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.RegionCertificateAuthorities\n[5] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-certificates.html\n[6] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/create-db-instance.html\n[7] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[8] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[9] https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/rotate-your-ssl-tls-certificates-now-amazon-rds-and-amazon-aurora-expire-in-2024/\n[10] https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home",

For information on setting an account level CA override, see the modify-certificates API documentation [1].\n\nIf your applications connect to these instances using the SSL/TLS protocol, you will need to take action before August 22, 2024 to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances. Even if you do not currently use SSL for your connections, you could still be affected if your databases server certificate expires, so we still recommend updating your CA.\n\nTo protect your communications with your database instances, a CA generates time-bound certificates that are checked by your database client software to authenticate any database instance before exchanging information. Following industry best practices, AWS renews the CA and creates new certificates on a routine basis to ensure customer connections are properly protected for years to come. The current CA in the EU-WEST-1 Region will expire on August 22, 2024. Before this date you will need to update your DB server certificate. The following is the general process to do this:\n\nFirst, update your application clients with the new certificate, if your application client is using a trust store then add the new CA certificates into the trust stores of your client applications. RDS provides download links to the CA certificates in our User Guide [2]. For more detailed instructions on updating the trust stores on your client application see our documentation [3].\n\nSecond, update the certificate on all your affected database instances to one of the newly issued CAs. \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 is the default recommended CA because there is no algorithm change. The other CAs use new key algorithms so it could require more testing of your client setup to ensure compatibility. For more information on the new CAs see our documentation [4].\n\nThird, if you want to use a different CA than the default \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019, you will need to set an account level CA override so your new instances will use the CA of your choice. To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later. For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs. \n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 certificate. If you wish for new instances to use a different certificate, you can specify which certificate to use with the AWS console or the AWS CLI. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\n3. After August 22, 2024 - \u2018rds-ca-2019\u2019 will expire. You will need to take action before August 22, 2024, to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances.\n\nFor more information see our blog [9], and if you have questions or concerns, please contact AWS Support [10].\n\n[1] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/modify-certificates.html\n[2] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.CertificatesAllRegions\n[3] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation-updating\n[4] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.RegionCertificateAuthorities\n[5] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-certificates.html\n[6] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/create-db-instance.html\n[7] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[8] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[9] https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/rotate-your-ssl-tls-certificates-now-amazon-rds-and-amazon-aurora-expire-in-2024/\n[10] https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home",

If you believe you have already finished this work and still received this email, it is likely because you created new instances using the 2019 Certificate Authority (CA). After January 25, 2024 all newly created instances that do not explicitly specify a different CA will use the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 CA. For information on setting an account level CA override, see the modify-certificates API documentation [1].\n\nIf your applications connect to these instances using the SSL/TLS protocol, you will need to take action before August 22, 2024 to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances. Even if you do not currently use SSL for your connections, you could still be affected if your databases server certificate expires, so we still recommend updating your CA.\n\nTo protect your communications with your database instances, a CA generates time-bound certificates that are checked by your database client software to authenticate any database instance before exchanging information. Following industry best practices, AWS renews the CA and creates new certificates on a routine basis to ensure customer connections are properly protected for years to come. The current CA in the EU-WEST-1 Region will expire on August 22, 2024. Before this date you will need to update your DB server certificate. The following is the general process to do this:\n\nFirst, update your application clients with the new certificate, if your application client is using a trust store then add the new CA certificates into the trust stores of your client applications. RDS provides download links to the CA certificates in our User Guide [2]. For more detailed instructions on updating the trust stores on your client application see our documentation [3].\n\nSecond, update the certificate on all your affected database instances to one of the newly issued CAs. \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 is the default recommended CA because there is no algorithm change. The other CAs use new key algorithms so it could require more testing of your client setup to ensure compatibility. For more information on the new CAs see our documentation [4].\n\nThird, if you want to use a different CA than the default \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019, you will need to set an account level CA override so your new instances will use the CA of your choice. To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later. For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs. \n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 certificate. If you wish for new instances to use a different certificate, you can specify which certificate to use with the AWS console or the AWS CLI. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\n3. After August 22, 2024 - \u2018rds-ca-2019\u2019 will expire.

If you believe you have already finished this work and still received this email, it is likely because you created new instances using the 2019 Certificate Authority (CA). After January 25, 2024 all newly created instances that do not explicitly specify a different CA will use the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 CA. For information on setting an account level CA override, see the modify-certificates API documentation [1].\n\nIf your applications connect to these instances using the SSL/TLS protocol, you will need to take action before August 22, 2024 to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances. Even if you do not currently use SSL for your connections, you could still be affected if your databases server certificate expires, so we still recommend updating your CA.\n\nTo protect your communications with your database instances, a CA generates time-bound certificates that are checked by your database client software to authenticate any database instance before exchanging information. Following industry best practices, AWS renews the CA and creates new certificates on a routine basis to ensure customer connections are properly protected for years to come. The current CA in the EU-WEST-1 Region will expire on August 22, 2024. Before this date you will need to update your DB server certificate. The following is the general process to do this:\n\nFirst, update your application clients with the new certificate, if your application client is using a trust store then add the new CA certificates into the trust stores of your client applications. RDS provides download links to the CA certificates in our User Guide [2]. For more detailed instructions on updating the trust stores on your client application see our documentation [3].\n\nSecond, update the certificate on all your affected database instances to one of the newly issued CAs. \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 is the default recommended CA because there is no algorithm change. The other CAs use new key algorithms so it could require more testing of your client setup to ensure compatibility. For more information on the new CAs see our documentation [4].\n\nThird, if you want to use a different CA than the default \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019, you will need to set an account level CA override so your new instances will use the CA of your choice. To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later. For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs. \n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 certificate. If you wish for new instances to use a different certificate, you can specify which certificate to use with the AWS console or the AWS CLI. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\n3. After August 22, 2024 - \u2018rds-ca-2019\u2019 will expire. You will need to take action before August 22, 2024, to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances.\n\nFor more information see our blog [9], and if you have questions or concerns, please contact AWS Support [10].\n\n[1] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/modify-certificates.html\n[2] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.CertificatesAllRegions\n[3] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation-updating\n[4] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.RegionCertificateAuthorities\n[5] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-certificates.html\n[6] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/create-db-instance.html\n[7] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[8] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[9] https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/rotate-your-ssl-tls-certificates-now-amazon-rds-and-amazon-aurora-expire-in-2024/\n[10] https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home",

For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs. \n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 certificate. If you wish for new instances to use a different certificate, you can specify which certificate to use with the AWS console or the AWS CLI. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\n3. After August 22, 2024 - \u2018rds-ca-2019\u2019 will expire. You will need to take action before August 22, 2024, to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances.\n\nFor more information see our blog [9], and if you have questions or concerns, please contact AWS Support [10].\n\n[1] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/modify-certificates.html\n[2] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.CertificatesAllRegions\n[3] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation-updating\n[4] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.RegionCertificateAuthorities\n[5] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-certificates.html\n[6] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/create-db-instance.html\n[7] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[8] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[9] https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/rotate-your-ssl-tls-certificates-now-amazon-rds-and-amazon-aurora-expire-in-2024/\n[10] https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home",

If you believe you have already finished this work and still received this email, it is likely because you created new instances using the 2019 Certificate Authority (CA). After January 25, 2024 all newly created instances that do not explicitly specify a different CA will use the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 CA. For information on setting an account level CA override, see the modify-certificates API documentation [1].\n\nIf your applications connect to these instances using the SSL/TLS protocol, you will need to take action before August 22, 2024 to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances. Even if you do not currently use SSL for your connections, you could still be affected if your databases server certificate expires, so we still recommend updating your CA.\n\nTo protect your communications with your database instances, a CA generates time-bound certificates that are checked by your database client software to authenticate any database instance before exchanging information. Following industry best practices, AWS renews the CA and creates new certificates on a routine basis to ensure customer connections are properly protected for years to come. The current CA in the EU-WEST-1 Region will expire on August 22, 2024. Before this date you will need to update your DB server certificate. The following is the general process to do this:\n\nFirst, update your application clients with the new certificate, if your application client is using a trust store then add the new CA certificates into the trust stores of your client applications. RDS provides download links to the CA certificates in our User Guide [2]. For more detailed instructions on updating the trust stores on your client application see our documentation [3].\n\nSecond, update the certificate on all your affected database instances to one of the newly issued CAs. \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 is the default recommended CA because there is no algorithm change. The other CAs use new key algorithms so it could require more testing of your client setup to ensure compatibility. For more information on the new CAs see our documentation [4].\n\nThird, if you want to use a different CA than the default \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019, you will need to set an account level CA override so your new instances will use the CA of your choice.

Following industry best practices, AWS renews the CA and creates new certificates on a routine basis to ensure customer connections are properly protected for years to come. The current CA in the EU-WEST-1 Region will expire on August 22, 2024. Before this date you will need to update your DB server certificate. The following is the general process to do this:\n\nFirst, update your application clients with the new certificate, if your application client is using a trust store then add the new CA certificates into the trust stores of your client applications. RDS provides download links to the CA certificates in our User Guide [2]. For more detailed instructions on updating the trust stores on your client application see our documentation [3].\n\nSecond, update the certificate on all your affected database instances to one of the newly issued CAs. \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 is the default recommended CA because there is no algorithm change. The other CAs use new key algorithms so it could require more testing of your client setup to ensure compatibility. For more information on the new CAs see our documentation [4].\n\nThird, if you want to use a different CA than the default \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019, you will need to set an account level CA override so your new instances will use the CA of your choice. To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later. For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs. \n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 certificate. If you wish for new instances to use a different certificate, you can specify which certificate to use with the AWS console or the AWS CLI. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\n3. After August 22, 2024 - \u2018rds-ca-2019\u2019 will expire. You will need to take action before August 22, 2024, to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances.\n\nFor more information see our blog [9], and if you have questions or concerns, please contact AWS Support [10].\n\n[1] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/modify-certificates.html\n[2] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.CertificatesAllRegions\n[3] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation-updating\n[4] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.RegionCertificateAuthorities\n[5] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-certificates.html\n[6] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/create-db-instance.html\n[7] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[8] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[9] https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/rotate-your-ssl-tls-certificates-now-amazon-rds-and-amazon-aurora-expire-in-2024/\n[10] https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home",

If you believe you have already finished this work and still received this email, it is likely because you created new instances using the 2019 Certificate Authority (CA). After January 25, 2024 all newly created instances that do not explicitly specify a different CA will use the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 CA. For information on setting an account level CA override, see the modify-certificates API documentation [1].\n\nIf your applications connect to these instances using the SSL/TLS protocol, you will need to take action before August 22, 2024 to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances. Even if you do not currently use SSL for your connections, you could still be affected if your databases server certificate expires, so we still recommend updating your CA.\n\nTo protect your communications with your database instances, a CA generates time-bound certificates that are checked by your database client software to authenticate any database instance before exchanging information. Following industry best practices, AWS renews the CA and creates new certificates on a routine basis to ensure customer connections are properly protected for years to come. The current CA in the EU-WEST-1 Region will expire on August 22, 2024. Before this date you will need to update your DB server certificate. The following is the general process to do this:\n\nFirst, update your application clients with the new certificate, if your application client is using a trust store then add the new CA certificates into the trust stores of your client applications. RDS provides download links to the CA certificates in our User Guide [2]. For more detailed instructions on updating the trust stores on your client application see our documentation [3].\n\nSecond, update the certificate on all your affected database instances to one of the newly issued CAs. \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 is the default recommended CA because there is no algorithm change. The other CAs use new key algorithms so it could require more testing of your client setup to ensure compatibility. For more information on the new CAs see our documentation [4].\n\nThird, if you want to use a different CA than the default \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019, you will need to set an account level CA override so your new instances will use the CA of your choice. To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later. For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs. \n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 certificate. If you wish for new instances to use a different certificate, you can specify which certificate to use with the AWS console or the AWS CLI. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\n3. After August 22, 2024 - \u2018rds-ca-2019\u2019 will expire.

If you believe you have already finished this work and still received this email, it is likely because you created new instances using the 2019 Certificate Authority (CA). After January 25, 2024 all newly created instances that do not explicitly specify a different CA will use the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 CA. For information on setting an account level CA override, see the modify-certificates API documentation [1].\n\nIf your applications connect to these instances using the SSL/TLS protocol, you will need to take action before August 22, 2024 to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances. Even if you do not currently use SSL for your connections, you could still be affected if your databases server certificate expires, so we still recommend updating your CA.\n\nTo protect your communications with your database instances, a CA generates time-bound certificates that are checked by your database client software to authenticate any database instance before exchanging information. Following industry best practices, AWS renews the CA and creates new certificates on a routine basis to ensure customer connections are properly protected for years to come. The current CA in the EU-WEST-1 Region will expire on August 22, 2024. Before this date you will need to update your DB server certificate. The following is the general process to do this:\n\nFirst, update your application clients with the new certificate, if your application client is using a trust store then add the new CA certificates into the trust stores of your client applications. RDS provides download links to the CA certificates in our User Guide [2]. For more detailed instructions on updating the trust stores on your client application see our documentation [3].\n\nSecond, update the certificate on all your affected database instances to one of the newly issued CAs. \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 is the default recommended CA because there is no algorithm change. The other CAs use new key algorithms so it could require more testing of your client setup to ensure compatibility. For more information on the new CAs see our documentation [4].\n\nThird, if you want to use a different CA than the default \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019, you will need to set an account level CA override so your new instances will use the CA of your choice. To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later. For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs. \n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 certificate. If you wish for new instances to use a different certificate, you can specify which certificate to use with the AWS console or the AWS CLI. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\n3. After August 22, 2024 - \u2018rds-ca-2019\u2019 will expire.

If you believe you have already finished this work and still received this email, it is likely because you created new instances using the 2019 Certificate Authority (CA). After January 25, 2024 all newly created instances that do not explicitly specify a different CA will use the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 CA. For information on setting an account level CA override, see the modify-certificates API documentation [1].\n\nIf your applications connect to these instances using the SSL/TLS protocol, you will need to take action before August 22, 2024 to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances. Even if you do not currently use SSL for your connections, you could still be affected if your databases server certificate expires, so we still recommend updating your CA.\n\nTo protect your communications with your database instances, a CA generates time-bound certificates that are checked by your database client software to authenticate any database instance before exchanging information. Following industry best practices, AWS renews the CA and creates new certificates on a routine basis to ensure customer connections are properly protected for years to come. The current CA in the EU-WEST-1 Region will expire on August 22, 2024. Before this date you will need to update your DB server certificate. The following is the general process to do this:\n\nFirst, update your application clients with the new certificate, if your application client is using a trust store then add the new CA certificates into the trust stores of your client applications. RDS provides download links to the CA certificates in our User Guide [2]. For more detailed instructions on updating the trust stores on your client application see our documentation [3].\n\nSecond, update the certificate on all your affected database instances to one of the newly issued CAs. \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 is the default recommended CA because there is no algorithm change. The other CAs use new key algorithms so it could require more testing of your client setup to ensure compatibility. For more information on the new CAs see our documentation [4].\n\nThird, if you want to use a different CA than the default \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019, you will need to set an account level CA override so your new instances will use the CA of your choice. To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later. For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs. \n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 certificate.

To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later. For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs. \n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 certificate. If you wish for new instances to use a different certificate, you can specify which certificate to use with the AWS console or the AWS CLI. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\n3. After August 22, 2024 - \u2018rds-ca-2019\u2019 will expire. You will need to take action before August 22, 2024, to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances.\n\nFor more information see our blog [9], and if you have questions or concerns, please contact AWS Support [10].\n\n[1] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/modify-certificates.html\n[2] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.CertificatesAllRegions\n[3] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation-updating\n[4] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.RegionCertificateAuthorities\n[5] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-certificates.html\n[6] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/create-db-instance.html\n[7] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[8] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[9] https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/rotate-your-ssl-tls-certificates-now-amazon-rds-and-amazon-aurora-expire-in-2024/\n[10] https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home",

For information on setting an account level CA override, see the modify-certificates API documentation [1].\n\nIf your applications connect to these instances using the SSL/TLS protocol, you will need to take action before August 22, 2024 to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances. Even if you do not currently use SSL for your connections, you could still be affected if your databases server certificate expires, so we still recommend updating your CA.\n\nTo protect your communications with your database instances, a CA generates time-bound certificates that are checked by your database client software to authenticate any database instance before exchanging information. Following industry best practices, AWS renews the CA and creates new certificates on a routine basis to ensure customer connections are properly protected for years to come. The current CA in the EU-WEST-1 Region will expire on August 22, 2024. Before this date you will need to update your DB server certificate. The following is the general process to do this:\n\nFirst, update your application clients with the new certificate, if your application client is using a trust store then add the new CA certificates into the trust stores of your client applications. RDS provides download links to the CA certificates in our User Guide [2]. For more detailed instructions on updating the trust stores on your client application see our documentation [3].\n\nSecond, update the certificate on all your affected database instances to one of the newly issued CAs. \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 is the default recommended CA because there is no algorithm change. The other CAs use new key algorithms so it could require more testing of your client setup to ensure compatibility. For more information on the new CAs see our documentation [4].\n\nThird, if you want to use a different CA than the default \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019, you will need to set an account level CA override so your new instances will use the CA of your choice. To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later. For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs. \n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 certificate. If you wish for new instances to use a different certificate, you can specify which certificate to use with the AWS console or the AWS CLI. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\n3. After August 22, 2024 - \u2018rds-ca-2019\u2019 will expire. You will need to take action before August 22, 2024, to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances.\n\nFor more information see our blog [9], and if you have questions or concerns, please contact AWS Support [10].\n\n[1] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/modify-certificates.html\n[2] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.CertificatesAllRegions\n[3] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation-updating\n[4] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.RegionCertificateAuthorities\n[5] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-certificates.html\n[6] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/create-db-instance.html\n[7] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[8] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[9] https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/rotate-your-ssl-tls-certificates-now-amazon-rds-and-amazon-aurora-expire-in-2024/\n[10] https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home",

If you believe you have already finished this work and still received this email, it is likely because you created new instances using the 2019 Certificate Authority (CA). After January 25, 2024 all newly created instances that do not explicitly specify a different CA will use the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 CA. For information on setting an account level CA override, see the modify-certificates API documentation [1].\n\nIf your applications connect to these instances using the SSL/TLS protocol, you will need to take action before August 22, 2024 to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances. Even if you do not currently use SSL for your connections, you could still be affected if your databases server certificate expires, so we still recommend updating your CA.\n\nTo protect your communications with your database instances, a CA generates time-bound certificates that are checked by your database client software to authenticate any database instance before exchanging information. Following industry best practices, AWS renews the CA and creates new certificates on a routine basis to ensure customer connections are properly protected for years to come. The current CA in the EU-WEST-1 Region will expire on August 22, 2024. Before this date you will need to update your DB server certificate. The following is the general process to do this:\n\nFirst, update your application clients with the new certificate, if your application client is using a trust store then add the new CA certificates into the trust stores of your client applications. RDS provides download links to the CA certificates in our User Guide [2]. For more detailed instructions on updating the trust stores on your client application see our documentation [3].\n\nSecond, update the certificate on all your affected database instances to one of the newly issued CAs. \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 is the default recommended CA because there is no algorithm change. The other CAs use new key algorithms so it could require more testing of your client setup to ensure compatibility. For more information on the new CAs see our documentation [4].\n\nThird, if you want to use a different CA than the default \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019, you will need to set an account level CA override so your new instances will use the CA of your choice. To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later. For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs. \n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 certificate. If you wish for new instances to use a different certificate, you can specify which certificate to use with the AWS console or the AWS CLI. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\n3. After August 22, 2024 - \u2018rds-ca-2019\u2019 will expire.

If you believe you have already finished this work and still received this email, it is likely because you created new instances using the 2019 Certificate Authority (CA). After January 25, 2024 all newly created instances that do not explicitly specify a different CA will use the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 CA. For information on setting an account level CA override, see the modify-certificates API documentation [1].\n\nIf your applications connect to these instances using the SSL/TLS protocol, you will need to take action before August 22, 2024 to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances. Even if you do not currently use SSL for your connections, you could still be affected if your databases server certificate expires, so we still recommend updating your CA.\n\nTo protect your communications with your database instances, a CA generates time-bound certificates that are checked by your database client software to authenticate any database instance before exchanging information. Following industry best practices, AWS renews the CA and creates new certificates on a routine basis to ensure customer connections are properly protected for years to come. The current CA in the EU-WEST-1 Region will expire on August 22, 2024. Before this date you will need to update your DB server certificate. The following is the general process to do this:\n\nFirst, update your application clients with the new certificate, if your application client is using a trust store then add the new CA certificates into the trust stores of your client applications. RDS provides download links to the CA certificates in our User Guide [2]. For more detailed instructions on updating the trust stores on your client application see our documentation [3].\n\nSecond, update the certificate on all your affected database instances to one of the newly issued CAs. \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 is the default recommended CA because there is no algorithm change. The other CAs use new key algorithms so it could require more testing of your client setup to ensure compatibility. For more information on the new CAs see our documentation [4].\n\nThird, if you want to use a different CA than the default \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019, you will need to set an account level CA override so your new instances will use the CA of your choice. To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later. For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs. \n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 certificate. If you wish for new instances to use a different certificate, you can specify which certificate to use with the AWS console or the AWS CLI. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\n3. After August 22, 2024 - \u2018rds-ca-2019\u2019 will expire. You will need to take action before August 22, 2024, to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances.\n\nFor more information see our blog [9], and if you have questions or concerns, please contact AWS Support [10].\n\n[1] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/modify-certificates.html\n[2] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.CertificatesAllRegions\n[3] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation-updating\n[4] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.RegionCertificateAuthorities\n[5] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-certificates.html\n[6] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/create-db-instance.html\n[7] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[8] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[9] https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/rotate-your-ssl-tls-certificates-now-amazon-rds-and-amazon-aurora-expire-in-2024/\n[10] https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home",

For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs. \n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 certificate. If you wish for new instances to use a different certificate, you can specify which certificate to use with the AWS console or the AWS CLI. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\n3. After August 22, 2024 - \u2018rds-ca-2019\u2019 will expire. You will need to take action before August 22, 2024, to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances.\n\nFor more information see our blog [9], and if you have questions or concerns, please contact AWS Support [10].\n\n[1] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/modify-certificates.html\n[2] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.CertificatesAllRegions\n[3] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation-updating\n[4] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.RegionCertificateAuthorities\n[5] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-certificates.html\n[6] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/create-db-instance.html\n[7] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[8] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[9] https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/rotate-your-ssl-tls-certificates-now-amazon-rds-and-amazon-aurora-expire-in-2024/\n[10] https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home",

If you believe you have already finished this work and still received this email, it is likely because you created new instances using the 2019 Certificate Authority (CA). After January 25, 2024 all newly created instances that do not explicitly specify a different CA will use the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 CA. For information on setting an account level CA override, see the modify-certificates API documentation [1].\n\nIf your applications connect to these instances using the SSL/TLS protocol, you will need to take action before August 22, 2024 to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances. Even if you do not currently use SSL for your connections, you could still be affected if your databases server certificate expires, so we still recommend updating your CA.\n\nTo protect your communications with your database instances, a CA generates time-bound certificates that are checked by your database client software to authenticate any database instance before exchanging information. Following industry best practices, AWS renews the CA and creates new certificates on a routine basis to ensure customer connections are properly protected for years to come. The current CA in the EU-WEST-1 Region will expire on August 22, 2024. Before this date you will need to update your DB server certificate. The following is the general process to do this:\n\nFirst, update your application clients with the new certificate, if your application client is using a trust store then add the new CA certificates into the trust stores of your client applications. RDS provides download links to the CA certificates in our User Guide [2]. For more detailed instructions on updating the trust stores on your client application see our documentation [3].\n\nSecond, update the certificate on all your affected database instances to one of the newly issued CAs. \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 is the default recommended CA because there is no algorithm change. The other CAs use new key algorithms so it could require more testing of your client setup to ensure compatibility. For more information on the new CAs see our documentation [4].\n\nThird, if you want to use a different CA than the default \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019, you will need to set an account level CA override so your new instances will use the CA of your choice.

Following industry best practices, AWS renews the CA and creates new certificates on a routine basis to ensure customer connections are properly protected for years to come. The current CA in the EU-WEST-1 Region will expire on August 22, 2024. Before this date you will need to update your DB server certificate. The following is the general process to do this:\n\nFirst, update your application clients with the new certificate, if your application client is using a trust store then add the new CA certificates into the trust stores of your client applications. RDS provides download links to the CA certificates in our User Guide [2]. For more detailed instructions on updating the trust stores on your client application see our documentation [3].\n\nSecond, update the certificate on all your affected database instances to one of the newly issued CAs. \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 is the default recommended CA because there is no algorithm change. The other CAs use new key algorithms so it could require more testing of your client setup to ensure compatibility. For more information on the new CAs see our documentation [4].\n\nThird, if you want to use a different CA than the default \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019, you will need to set an account level CA override so your new instances will use the CA of your choice. To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later. For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs. \n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 certificate. If you wish for new instances to use a different certificate, you can specify which certificate to use with the AWS console or the AWS CLI. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\n3. After August 22, 2024 - \u2018rds-ca-2019\u2019 will expire. You will need to take action before August 22, 2024, to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances.\n\nFor more information see our blog [9], and if you have questions or concerns, please contact AWS Support [10].\n\n[1] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/modify-certificates.html\n[2] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.CertificatesAllRegions\n[3] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation-updating\n[4] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.RegionCertificateAuthorities\n[5] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-certificates.html\n[6] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/create-db-instance.html\n[7] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[8] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[9] https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/rotate-your-ssl-tls-certificates-now-amazon-rds-and-amazon-aurora-expire-in-2024/\n[10] https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home",

If you believe you have already finished this work and still received this email, it is likely because you created new instances using the 2019 Certificate Authority (CA). After January 25, 2024 all newly created instances that do not explicitly specify a different CA will use the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 CA. For information on setting an account level CA override, see the modify-certificates API documentation [1].\n\nIf your applications connect to these instances using the SSL/TLS protocol, you will need to take action before August 22, 2024 to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances. Even if you do not currently use SSL for your connections, you could still be affected if your databases server certificate expires, so we still recommend updating your CA.\n\nTo protect your communications with your database instances, a CA generates time-bound certificates that are checked by your database client software to authenticate any database instance before exchanging information. Following industry best practices, AWS renews the CA and creates new certificates on a routine basis to ensure customer connections are properly protected for years to come. The current CA in the EU-WEST-1 Region will expire on August 22, 2024. Before this date you will need to update your DB server certificate. The following is the general process to do this:\n\nFirst, update your application clients with the new certificate, if your application client is using a trust store then add the new CA certificates into the trust stores of your client applications. RDS provides download links to the CA certificates in our User Guide [2]. For more detailed instructions on updating the trust stores on your client application see our documentation [3].\n\nSecond, update the certificate on all your affected database instances to one of the newly issued CAs. \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 is the default recommended CA because there is no algorithm change. The other CAs use new key algorithms so it could require more testing of your client setup to ensure compatibility. For more information on the new CAs see our documentation [4].\n\nThird, if you want to use a different CA than the default \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019, you will need to set an account level CA override so your new instances will use the CA of your choice. To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later. For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs. \n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 certificate. If you wish for new instances to use a different certificate, you can specify which certificate to use with the AWS console or the AWS CLI. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\n3. After August 22, 2024 - \u2018rds-ca-2019\u2019 will expire.

If you believe you have already finished this work and still received this email, it is likely because you created new instances using the 2019 Certificate Authority (CA). After January 25, 2024 all newly created instances that do not explicitly specify a different CA will use the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 CA. For information on setting an account level CA override, see the modify-certificates API documentation [1].\n\nIf your applications connect to these instances using the SSL/TLS protocol, you will need to take action before August 22, 2024 to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances. Even if you do not currently use SSL for your connections, you could still be affected if your databases server certificate expires, so we still recommend updating your CA.\n\nTo protect your communications with your database instances, a CA generates time-bound certificates that are checked by your database client software to authenticate any database instance before exchanging information. Following industry best practices, AWS renews the CA and creates new certificates on a routine basis to ensure customer connections are properly protected for years to come. The current CA in the EU-WEST-1 Region will expire on August 22, 2024. Before this date you will need to update your DB server certificate. The following is the general process to do this:\n\nFirst, update your application clients with the new certificate, if your application client is using a trust store then add the new CA certificates into the trust stores of your client applications. RDS provides download links to the CA certificates in our User Guide [2]. For more detailed instructions on updating the trust stores on your client application see our documentation [3].\n\nSecond, update the certificate on all your affected database instances to one of the newly issued CAs. \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 is the default recommended CA because there is no algorithm change. The other CAs use new key algorithms so it could require more testing of your client setup to ensure compatibility. For more information on the new CAs see our documentation [4].\n\nThird, if you want to use a different CA than the default \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019, you will need to set an account level CA override so your new instances will use the CA of your choice. To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later. For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs. \n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 certificate. If you wish for new instances to use a different certificate, you can specify which certificate to use with the AWS console or the AWS CLI. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\n3. After August 22, 2024 - \u2018rds-ca-2019\u2019 will expire.

If you believe you have already finished this work and still received this email, it is likely because you created new instances using the 2019 Certificate Authority (CA). After January 25, 2024 all newly created instances that do not explicitly specify a different CA will use the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 CA. For information on setting an account level CA override, see the modify-certificates API documentation [1].\n\nIf your applications connect to these instances using the SSL/TLS protocol, you will need to take action before August 22, 2024 to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances. Even if you do not currently use SSL for your connections, you could still be affected if your databases server certificate expires, so we still recommend updating your CA.\n\nTo protect your communications with your database instances, a CA generates time-bound certificates that are checked by your database client software to authenticate any database instance before exchanging information. Following industry best practices, AWS renews the CA and creates new certificates on a routine basis to ensure customer connections are properly protected for years to come. The current CA in the EU-WEST-1 Region will expire on August 22, 2024. Before this date you will need to update your DB server certificate. The following is the general process to do this:\n\nFirst, update your application clients with the new certificate, if your application client is using a trust store then add the new CA certificates into the trust stores of your client applications. RDS provides download links to the CA certificates in our User Guide [2]. For more detailed instructions on updating the trust stores on your client application see our documentation [3].\n\nSecond, update the certificate on all your affected database instances to one of the newly issued CAs. \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 is the default recommended CA because there is no algorithm change. The other CAs use new key algorithms so it could require more testing of your client setup to ensure compatibility. For more information on the new CAs see our documentation [4].\n\nThird, if you want to use a different CA than the default \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019, you will need to set an account level CA override so your new instances will use the CA of your choice. To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later. For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs. \n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 certificate.

To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later. For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs. \n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 certificate. If you wish for new instances to use a different certificate, you can specify which certificate to use with the AWS console or the AWS CLI. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\n3. After August 22, 2024 - \u2018rds-ca-2019\u2019 will expire. You will need to take action before August 22, 2024, to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances.\n\nFor more information see our blog [9], and if you have questions or concerns, please contact AWS Support [10].\n\n[1] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/modify-certificates.html\n[2] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.CertificatesAllRegions\n[3] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation-updating\n[4] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.RegionCertificateAuthorities\n[5] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-certificates.html\n[6] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/create-db-instance.html\n[7] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[8] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[9] https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/rotate-your-ssl-tls-certificates-now-amazon-rds-and-amazon-aurora-expire-in-2024/\n[10] https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home",

For information on setting an account level CA override, see the modify-certificates API documentation [1].\n\nIf your applications connect to these instances using the SSL/TLS protocol, you will need to take action before August 22, 2024 to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances. Even if you do not currently use SSL for your connections, you could still be affected if your databases server certificate expires, so we still recommend updating your CA.\n\nTo protect your communications with your database instances, a CA generates time-bound certificates that are checked by your database client software to authenticate any database instance before exchanging information. Following industry best practices, AWS renews the CA and creates new certificates on a routine basis to ensure customer connections are properly protected for years to come. The current CA in the EU-WEST-1 Region will expire on August 22, 2024. Before this date you will need to update your DB server certificate. The following is the general process to do this:\n\nFirst, update your application clients with the new certificate, if your application client is using a trust store then add the new CA certificates into the trust stores of your client applications. RDS provides download links to the CA certificates in our User Guide [2]. For more detailed instructions on updating the trust stores on your client application see our documentation [3].\n\nSecond, update the certificate on all your affected database instances to one of the newly issued CAs. \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 is the default recommended CA because there is no algorithm change. The other CAs use new key algorithms so it could require more testing of your client setup to ensure compatibility. For more information on the new CAs see our documentation [4].\n\nThird, if you want to use a different CA than the default \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019, you will need to set an account level CA override so your new instances will use the CA of your choice. To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later. For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs. \n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 certificate. If you wish for new instances to use a different certificate, you can specify which certificate to use with the AWS console or the AWS CLI. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\n3. After August 22, 2024 - \u2018rds-ca-2019\u2019 will expire. You will need to take action before August 22, 2024, to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances.\n\nFor more information see our blog [9], and if you have questions or concerns, please contact AWS Support [10].\n\n[1] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/modify-certificates.html\n[2] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.CertificatesAllRegions\n[3] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation-updating\n[4] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.RegionCertificateAuthorities\n[5] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-certificates.html\n[6] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/create-db-instance.html\n[7] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[8] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[9] https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/rotate-your-ssl-tls-certificates-now-amazon-rds-and-amazon-aurora-expire-in-2024/\n[10] https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home",

If you believe you have already finished this work and still received this email, it is likely because you created new instances using the 2019 Certificate Authority (CA). After January 25, 2024 all newly created instances that do not explicitly specify a different CA will use the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 CA. For information on setting an account level CA override, see the modify-certificates API documentation [1].\n\nIf your applications connect to these instances using the SSL/TLS protocol, you will need to take action before August 22, 2024 to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances. Even if you do not currently use SSL for your connections, you could still be affected if your databases server certificate expires, so we still recommend updating your CA.\n\nTo protect your communications with your database instances, a CA generates time-bound certificates that are checked by your database client software to authenticate any database instance before exchanging information. Following industry best practices, AWS renews the CA and creates new certificates on a routine basis to ensure customer connections are properly protected for years to come. The current CA in the EU-WEST-1 Region will expire on August 22, 2024. Before this date you will need to update your DB server certificate. The following is the general process to do this:\n\nFirst, update your application clients with the new certificate, if your application client is using a trust store then add the new CA certificates into the trust stores of your client applications. RDS provides download links to the CA certificates in our User Guide [2]. For more detailed instructions on updating the trust stores on your client application see our documentation [3].\n\nSecond, update the certificate on all your affected database instances to one of the newly issued CAs. \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 is the default recommended CA because there is no algorithm change. The other CAs use new key algorithms so it could require more testing of your client setup to ensure compatibility. For more information on the new CAs see our documentation [4].\n\nThird, if you want to use a different CA than the default \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019, you will need to set an account level CA override so your new instances will use the CA of your choice. To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later. For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs. \n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 certificate. If you wish for new instances to use a different certificate, you can specify which certificate to use with the AWS console or the AWS CLI. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\n3. After August 22, 2024 - \u2018rds-ca-2019\u2019 will expire.

If you believe you have already finished this work and still received this email, it is likely because you created new instances using the 2019 Certificate Authority (CA). After January 25, 2024 all newly created instances that do not explicitly specify a different CA will use the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 CA. For information on setting an account level CA override, see the modify-certificates API documentation [1].\n\nIf your applications connect to these instances using the SSL/TLS protocol, you will need to take action before August 22, 2024 to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances. Even if you do not currently use SSL for your connections, you could still be affected if your databases server certificate expires, so we still recommend updating your CA.\n\nTo protect your communications with your database instances, a CA generates time-bound certificates that are checked by your database client software to authenticate any database instance before exchanging information. Following industry best practices, AWS renews the CA and creates new certificates on a routine basis to ensure customer connections are properly protected for years to come. The current CA in the EU-WEST-1 Region will expire on August 22, 2024. Before this date you will need to update your DB server certificate. The following is the general process to do this:\n\nFirst, update your application clients with the new certificate, if your application client is using a trust store then add the new CA certificates into the trust stores of your client applications. RDS provides download links to the CA certificates in our User Guide [2]. For more detailed instructions on updating the trust stores on your client application see our documentation [3].\n\nSecond, update the certificate on all your affected database instances to one of the newly issued CAs. \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 is the default recommended CA because there is no algorithm change. The other CAs use new key algorithms so it could require more testing of your client setup to ensure compatibility. For more information on the new CAs see our documentation [4].\n\nThird, if you want to use a different CA than the default \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019, you will need to set an account level CA override so your new instances will use the CA of your choice. To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later. For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs. \n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 certificate. If you wish for new instances to use a different certificate, you can specify which certificate to use with the AWS console or the AWS CLI. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\n3. After August 22, 2024 - \u2018rds-ca-2019\u2019 will expire. You will need to take action before August 22, 2024, to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances.\n\nFor more information see our blog [9], and if you have questions or concerns, please contact AWS Support [10].\n\n[1] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/modify-certificates.html\n[2] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.CertificatesAllRegions\n[3] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation-updating\n[4] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.RegionCertificateAuthorities\n[5] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-certificates.html\n[6] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/create-db-instance.html\n[7] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[8] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[9] https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/rotate-your-ssl-tls-certificates-now-amazon-rds-and-amazon-aurora-expire-in-2024/\n[10] https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home",

To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later. For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs. \n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 certificate. If you wish for new instances to use a different certificate, you can specify which certificate to use with the AWS console or the AWS CLI. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\n3. After August 22, 2024 - \u2018rds-ca-2019\u2019 will expire. You will need to take action before August 22, 2024, to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances.\n\nFor more information see our blog [9], and if you have questions or concerns, please contact AWS Support [10].\n\n[1] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/modify-certificates.html\n[2] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.CertificatesAllRegions\n[3] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation-updating\n[4] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.RegionCertificateAuthorities\n[5] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-certificates.html\n[6] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/create-db-instance.html\n[7] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[8] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[9] https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/rotate-your-ssl-tls-certificates-now-amazon-rds-and-amazon-aurora-expire-in-2024/\n[10] https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home",

If you believe you have already finished this work and still received this email, it is likely because you created new instances using the 2019 Certificate Authority (CA). After January 25, 2024 all newly created instances that do not explicitly specify a different CA will use the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 CA. For information on setting an account level CA override, see the modify-certificates API documentation [1].\n\nIf your applications connect to these instances using the SSL/TLS protocol, you will need to take action before August 22, 2024 to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances. Even if you do not currently use SSL for your connections, you could still be affected if your databases server certificate expires, so we still recommend updating your CA.\n\nTo protect your communications with your database instances, a CA generates time-bound certificates that are checked by your database client software to authenticate any database instance before exchanging information. Following industry best practices, AWS renews the CA and creates new certificates on a routine basis to ensure customer connections are properly protected for years to come. The current CA in the EU-WEST-1 Region will expire on August 22, 2024. Before this date you will need to update your DB server certificate. The following is the general process to do this:\n\nFirst, update your application clients with the new certificate, if your application client is using a trust store then add the new CA certificates into the trust stores of your client applications. RDS provides download links to the CA certificates in our User Guide [2]. For more detailed instructions on updating the trust stores on your client application see our documentation [3].\n\nSecond, update the certificate on all your affected database instances to one of the newly issued CAs. \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 is the default recommended CA because there is no algorithm change.

For information on setting an account level CA override, see the modify-certificates API documentation [1].\n\nIf your applications connect to these instances using the SSL/TLS protocol, you will need to take action before August 22, 2024 to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances. Even if you do not currently use SSL for your connections, you could still be affected if your databases server certificate expires, so we still recommend updating your CA.\n\nTo protect your communications with your database instances, a CA generates time-bound certificates that are checked by your database client software to authenticate any database instance before exchanging information. Following industry best practices, AWS renews the CA and creates new certificates on a routine basis to ensure customer connections are properly protected for years to come. The current CA in the EU-WEST-1 Region will expire on August 22, 2024. Before this date you will need to update your DB server certificate. The following is the general process to do this:\n\nFirst, update your application clients with the new certificate, if your application client is using a trust store then add the new CA certificates into the trust stores of your client applications. RDS provides download links to the CA certificates in our User Guide [2]. For more detailed instructions on updating the trust stores on your client application see our documentation [3].\n\nSecond, update the certificate on all your affected database instances to one of the newly issued CAs. \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 is the default recommended CA because there is no algorithm change. The other CAs use new key algorithms so it could require more testing of your client setup to ensure compatibility. For more information on the new CAs see our documentation [4].\n\nThird, if you want to use a different CA than the default \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019, you will need to set an account level CA override so your new instances will use the CA of your choice. To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later. For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs. \n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 certificate. If you wish for new instances to use a different certificate, you can specify which certificate to use with the AWS console or the AWS CLI. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\n3. After August 22, 2024 - \u2018rds-ca-2019\u2019 will expire. You will need to take action before August 22, 2024, to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances.\n\nFor more information see our blog [9], and if you have questions or concerns, please contact AWS Support [10].\n\n[1] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/modify-certificates.html\n[2] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.CertificatesAllRegions\n[3] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation-updating\n[4] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.RegionCertificateAuthorities\n[5] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-certificates.html\n[6] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/create-db-instance.html\n[7] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[8] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[9] https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/rotate-your-ssl-tls-certificates-now-amazon-rds-and-amazon-aurora-expire-in-2024/\n[10] https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home",

If you believe you have already finished this work and still received this email, it is likely because you created new instances using the 2019 Certificate Authority (CA). After January 25, 2024 all newly created instances that do not explicitly specify a different CA will use the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 CA. For information on setting an account level CA override, see the modify-certificates API documentation [1].\n\nIf your applications connect to these instances using the SSL/TLS protocol, you will need to take action before August 22, 2024 to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances. Even if you do not currently use SSL for your connections, you could still be affected if your databases server certificate expires, so we still recommend updating your CA.\n\nTo protect your communications with your database instances, a CA generates time-bound certificates that are checked by your database client software to authenticate any database instance before exchanging information. Following industry best practices, AWS renews the CA and creates new certificates on a routine basis to ensure customer connections are properly protected for years to come. The current CA in the EU-WEST-1 Region will expire on August 22, 2024. Before this date you will need to update your DB server certificate. The following is the general process to do this:\n\nFirst, update your application clients with the new certificate, if your application client is using a trust store then add the new CA certificates into the trust stores of your client applications. RDS provides download links to the CA certificates in our User Guide [2]. For more detailed instructions on updating the trust stores on your client application see our documentation [3].\n\nSecond, update the certificate on all your affected database instances to one of the newly issued CAs. \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 is the default recommended CA because there is no algorithm change. The other CAs use new key algorithms so it could require more testing of your client setup to ensure compatibility. For more information on the new CAs see our documentation [4].\n\nThird, if you want to use a different CA than the default \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019, you will need to set an account level CA override so your new instances will use the CA of your choice. To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later. For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs. \n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 certificate. If you wish for new instances to use a different certificate, you can specify which certificate to use with the AWS console or the AWS CLI. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\n3. After August 22, 2024 - \u2018rds-ca-2019\u2019 will expire.

For more information on the new CAs see our documentation [4].\n\nThird, if you want to use a different CA than the default \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019, you will need to set an account level CA override so your new instances will use the CA of your choice. To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later. For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs. \n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 certificate. If you wish for new instances to use a different certificate, you can specify which certificate to use with the AWS console or the AWS CLI. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\n3. After August 22, 2024 - \u2018rds-ca-2019\u2019 will expire. You will need to take action before August 22, 2024, to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances.\n\nFor more information see our blog [9], and if you have questions or concerns, please contact AWS Support [10].\n\n[1] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/modify-certificates.html\n[2] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.CertificatesAllRegions\n[3] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation-updating\n[4] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.RegionCertificateAuthorities\n[5] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-certificates.html\n[6] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/create-db-instance.html\n[7] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[8] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[9] https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/rotate-your-ssl-tls-certificates-now-amazon-rds-and-amazon-aurora-expire-in-2024/\n[10] https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home",

After January 25, 2024 all newly created instances that do not explicitly specify a different CA will use the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 CA. For information on setting an account level CA override, see the modify-certificates API documentation [1].\n\nIf your applications connect to these instances using the SSL/TLS protocol, you will need to take action before August 22, 2024 to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances. Even if you do not currently use SSL for your connections, you could still be affected if your databases server certificate expires, so we still recommend updating your CA.\n\nTo protect your communications with your database instances, a CA generates time-bound certificates that are checked by your database client software to authenticate any database instance before exchanging information. Following industry best practices, AWS renews the CA and creates new certificates on a routine basis to ensure customer connections are properly protected for years to come. The current CA in the EU-WEST-1 Region will expire on August 22, 2024. Before this date you will need to update your DB server certificate. The following is the general process to do this:\n\nFirst, update your application clients with the new certificate, if your application client is using a trust store then add the new CA certificates into the trust stores of your client applications. RDS provides download links to the CA certificates in our User Guide [2]. For more detailed instructions on updating the trust stores on your client application see our documentation [3].\n\nSecond, update the certificate on all your affected database instances to one of the newly issued CAs. \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 is the default recommended CA because there is no algorithm change. The other CAs use new key algorithms so it could require more testing of your client setup to ensure compatibility. For more information on the new CAs see our documentation [4].\n\nThird, if you want to use a different CA than the default \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019, you will need to set an account level CA override so your new instances will use the CA of your choice. To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later. For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs. \n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 certificate.

If you believe you have already finished this work and still received this email, it is likely because you created new instances using the 2019 Certificate Authority (CA). After January 25, 2024 all newly created instances that do not explicitly specify a different CA will use the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 CA. For information on setting an account level CA override, see the modify-certificates API documentation [1].\n\nIf your applications connect to these instances using the SSL/TLS protocol, you will need to take action before August 22, 2024 to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances. Even if you do not currently use SSL for your connections, you could still be affected if your databases server certificate expires, so we still recommend updating your CA.\n\nTo protect your communications with your database instances, a CA generates time-bound certificates that are checked by your database client software to authenticate any database instance before exchanging information. Following industry best practices, AWS renews the CA and creates new certificates on a routine basis to ensure customer connections are properly protected for years to come. The current CA in the EU-WEST-1 Region will expire on August 22, 2024. Before this date you will need to update your DB server certificate. The following is the general process to do this:\n\nFirst, update your application clients with the new certificate, if your application client is using a trust store then add the new CA certificates into the trust stores of your client applications. RDS provides download links to the CA certificates in our User Guide [2]. For more detailed instructions on updating the trust stores on your client application see our documentation [3].\n\nSecond, update the certificate on all your affected database instances to one of the newly issued CAs. \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 is the default recommended CA because there is no algorithm change. The other CAs use new key algorithms so it could require more testing of your client setup to ensure compatibility. For more information on the new CAs see our documentation [4].\n\nThird, if you want to use a different CA than the default \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019, you will need to set an account level CA override so your new instances will use the CA of your choice. To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later. For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs. \n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 certificate. If you wish for new instances to use a different certificate, you can specify which certificate to use with the AWS console or the AWS CLI. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\n3. After August 22, 2024 - \u2018rds-ca-2019\u2019 will expire. You will need to take action before August 22, 2024, to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances.\n\nFor more information see our blog [9], and if you have questions or concerns, please contact AWS Support [10].\n\n[1] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/modify-certificates.html\n[2] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.CertificatesAllRegions\n[3] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation-updating\n[4] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.RegionCertificateAuthorities\n[5] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-certificates.html\n[6] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/create-db-instance.html\n[7] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[8] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[9] https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/rotate-your-ssl-tls-certificates-now-amazon-rds-and-amazon-aurora-expire-in-2024/\n[10] https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home",

If you believe you have already finished this work and still received this email, it is likely because you created new instances using the 2019 Certificate Authority (CA). After January 25, 2024 all newly created instances that do not explicitly specify a different CA will use the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 CA. For information on setting an account level CA override, see the modify-certificates API documentation [1].\n\nIf your applications connect to these instances using the SSL/TLS protocol, you will need to take action before August 22, 2024 to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances. Even if you do not currently use SSL for your connections, you could still be affected if your databases server certificate expires, so we still recommend updating your CA.\n\nTo protect your communications with your database instances, a CA generates time-bound certificates that are checked by your database client software to authenticate any database instance before exchanging information. Following industry best practices, AWS renews the CA and creates new certificates on a routine basis to ensure customer connections are properly protected for years to come. The current CA in the EU-WEST-1 Region will expire on August 22, 2024. Before this date you will need to update your DB server certificate. The following is the general process to do this:\n\nFirst, update your application clients with the new certificate, if your application client is using a trust store then add the new CA certificates into the trust stores of your client applications. RDS provides download links to the CA certificates in our User Guide [2]. For more detailed instructions on updating the trust stores on your client application see our documentation [3].\n\nSecond, update the certificate on all your affected database instances to one of the newly issued CAs. \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 is the default recommended CA because there is no algorithm change. The other CAs use new key algorithms so it could require more testing of your client setup to ensure compatibility. For more information on the new CAs see our documentation [4].\n\nThird, if you want to use a different CA than the default \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019, you will need to set an account level CA override so your new instances will use the CA of your choice. To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later. For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs. \n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 certificate. If you wish for new instances to use a different certificate, you can specify which certificate to use with the AWS console or the AWS CLI.

To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later. For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs. \n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 certificate. If you wish for new instances to use a different certificate, you can specify which certificate to use with the AWS console or the AWS CLI. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\n3. After August 22, 2024 - \u2018rds-ca-2019\u2019 will expire. You will need to take action before August 22, 2024, to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances.\n\nFor more information see our blog [9], and if you have questions or concerns, please contact AWS Support [10].\n\n[1] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/modify-certificates.html\n[2] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.CertificatesAllRegions\n[3] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation-updating\n[4] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.RegionCertificateAuthorities\n[5] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-certificates.html\n[6] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/create-db-instance.html\n[7] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[8] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[9] https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/rotate-your-ssl-tls-certificates-now-amazon-rds-and-amazon-aurora-expire-in-2024/\n[10] https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home",

The current CA in the EU-WEST-1 Region will expire on August 22, 2024. Before this date you will need to update your DB server certificate.

For information on setting an account level CA override, see the modify-certificates API documentation [1].\n\nIf your applications connect to these instances using the SSL/TLS protocol, you will need to take action before August 22, 2024 to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances. Even if you do not currently use SSL for your connections, you could still be affected if your databases server certificate expires, so we still recommend updating your CA.\n\nTo protect your communications with your database instances, a CA generates time-bound certificates that are checked by your database client software to authenticate any database instance before exchanging information. Following industry best practices, AWS renews the CA and creates new certificates on a routine basis to ensure customer connections are properly protected for years to come. The current CA in the EU-WEST-1 Region will expire on August 22, 2024. Before this date you will need to update your DB server certificate. The following is the general process to do this:\n\nFirst, update your application clients with the new certificate, if your application client is using a trust store then add the new CA certificates into the trust stores of your client applications. RDS provides download links to the CA certificates in our User Guide [2]. For more detailed instructions on updating the trust stores on your client application see our documentation [3].\n\nSecond, update the certificate on all your affected database instances to one of the newly issued CAs. \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 is the default recommended CA because there is no algorithm change. The other CAs use new key algorithms so it could require more testing of your client setup to ensure compatibility. For more information on the new CAs see our documentation [4].\n\nThird, if you want to use a different CA than the default \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019, you will need to set an account level CA override so your new instances will use the CA of your choice. To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later. For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs. \n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 certificate. If you wish for new instances to use a different certificate, you can specify which certificate to use with the AWS console or the AWS CLI. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\n3. After August 22, 2024 - \u2018rds-ca-2019\u2019 will expire. You will need to take action before August 22, 2024, to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances.\n\nFor more information see our blog [9], and if you have questions or concerns, please contact AWS Support [10].\n\n[1] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/modify-certificates.html\n[2] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.CertificatesAllRegions\n[3] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation-updating\n[4] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.RegionCertificateAuthorities\n[5] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-certificates.html\n[6] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/create-db-instance.html\n[7] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[8] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[9] https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/rotate-your-ssl-tls-certificates-now-amazon-rds-and-amazon-aurora-expire-in-2024/\n[10] https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home",

If you believe you have already finished this work and still received this email, it is likely because you created new instances using the 2019 Certificate Authority (CA). After January 25, 2024 all newly created instances that do not explicitly specify a different CA will use the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 CA. For information on setting an account level CA override, see the modify-certificates API documentation [1].\n\nIf your applications connect to these instances using the SSL/TLS protocol, you will need to take action before August 22, 2024 to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances. Even if you do not currently use SSL for your connections, you could still be affected if your databases server certificate expires, so we still recommend updating your CA.\n\nTo protect your communications with your database instances, a CA generates time-bound certificates that are checked by your database client software to authenticate any database instance before exchanging information. Following industry best practices, AWS renews the CA and creates new certificates on a routine basis to ensure customer connections are properly protected for years to come. The current CA in the EU-WEST-1 Region will expire on August 22, 2024. Before this date you will need to update your DB server certificate. The following is the general process to do this:\n\nFirst, update your application clients with the new certificate, if your application client is using a trust store then add the new CA certificates into the trust stores of your client applications. RDS provides download links to the CA certificates in our User Guide [2]. For more detailed instructions on updating the trust stores on your client application see our documentation [3].\n\nSecond, update the certificate on all your affected database instances to one of the newly issued CAs. \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 is the default recommended CA because there is no algorithm change. The other CAs use new key algorithms so it could require more testing of your client setup to ensure compatibility. For more information on the new CAs see our documentation [4].\n\nThird, if you want to use a different CA than the default \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019, you will need to set an account level CA override so your new instances will use the CA of your choice. To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later. For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs. \n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 certificate. If you wish for new instances to use a different certificate, you can specify which certificate to use with the AWS console or the AWS CLI. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\n3. After August 22, 2024 - \u2018rds-ca-2019\u2019 will expire.

If you believe you have already finished this work and still received this email, it is likely because you created new instances using the 2019 Certificate Authority (CA). After January 25, 2024 all newly created instances that do not explicitly specify a different CA will use the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 CA. For information on setting an account level CA override, see the modify-certificates API documentation [1].\n\nIf your applications connect to these instances using the SSL/TLS protocol, you will need to take action before August 22, 2024 to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances. Even if you do not currently use SSL for your connections, you could still be affected if your databases server certificate expires, so we still recommend updating your CA.\n\nTo protect your communications with your database instances, a CA generates time-bound certificates that are checked by your database client software to authenticate any database instance before exchanging information. Following industry best practices, AWS renews the CA and creates new certificates on a routine basis to ensure customer connections are properly protected for years to come. The current CA in the EU-WEST-1 Region will expire on August 22, 2024. Before this date you will need to update your DB server certificate. The following is the general process to do this:\n\nFirst, update your application clients with the new certificate, if your application client is using a trust store then add the new CA certificates into the trust stores of your client applications. RDS provides download links to the CA certificates in our User Guide [2]. For more detailed instructions on updating the trust stores on your client application see our documentation [3].\n\nSecond, update the certificate on all your affected database instances to one of the newly issued CAs. \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 is the default recommended CA because there is no algorithm change. The other CAs use new key algorithms so it could require more testing of your client setup to ensure compatibility. For more information on the new CAs see our documentation [4].\n\nThird, if you want to use a different CA than the default \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019, you will need to set an account level CA override so your new instances will use the CA of your choice. To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later. For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs. \n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 certificate. If you wish for new instances to use a different certificate, you can specify which certificate to use with the AWS console or the AWS CLI. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\n3. After August 22, 2024 - \u2018rds-ca-2019\u2019 will expire. You will need to take action before August 22, 2024, to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances.\n\nFor more information see our blog [9], and if you have questions or concerns, please contact AWS Support [10].\n\n[1] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/modify-certificates.html\n[2] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.CertificatesAllRegions\n[3] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation-updating\n[4] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.RegionCertificateAuthorities\n[5] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-certificates.html\n[6] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/create-db-instance.html\n[7] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[8] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[9] https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/rotate-your-ssl-tls-certificates-now-amazon-rds-and-amazon-aurora-expire-in-2024/\n[10] https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home",

For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs. \n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 certificate. If you wish for new instances to use a different certificate, you can specify which certificate to use with the AWS console or the AWS CLI. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\n3. After August 22, 2024 - \u2018rds-ca-2019\u2019 will expire. You will need to take action before August 22, 2024, to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances.\n\nFor more information see our blog [9], and if you have questions or concerns, please contact AWS Support [10].\n\n[1] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/modify-certificates.html\n[2] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.CertificatesAllRegions\n[3] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation-updating\n[4] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.RegionCertificateAuthorities\n[5] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-certificates.html\n[6] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/create-db-instance.html\n[7] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[8] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[9] https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/rotate-your-ssl-tls-certificates-now-amazon-rds-and-amazon-aurora-expire-in-2024/\n[10] https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home",

If you believe you have already finished this work and still received this email, it is likely because you created new instances using the 2019 Certificate Authority (CA). After January 25, 2024 all newly created instances that do not explicitly specify a different CA will use the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 CA. For information on setting an account level CA override, see the modify-certificates API documentation [1].\n\nIf your applications connect to these instances using the SSL/TLS protocol, you will need to take action before August 22, 2024 to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances. Even if you do not currently use SSL for your connections, you could still be affected if your databases server certificate expires, so we still recommend updating your CA.\n\nTo protect your communications with your database instances, a CA generates time-bound certificates that are checked by your database client software to authenticate any database instance before exchanging information. Following industry best practices, AWS renews the CA and creates new certificates on a routine basis to ensure customer connections are properly protected for years to come. The current CA in the EU-WEST-1 Region will expire on August 22, 2024. Before this date you will need to update your DB server certificate. The following is the general process to do this:\n\nFirst, update your application clients with the new certificate, if your application client is using a trust store then add the new CA certificates into the trust stores of your client applications. RDS provides download links to the CA certificates in our User Guide [2]. For more detailed instructions on updating the trust stores on your client application see our documentation [3].\n\nSecond, update the certificate on all your affected database instances to one of the newly issued CAs. \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 is the default recommended CA because there is no algorithm change. The other CAs use new key algorithms so it could require more testing of your client setup to ensure compatibility. For more information on the new CAs see our documentation [4].\n\nThird, if you want to use a different CA than the default \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019, you will need to set an account level CA override so your new instances will use the CA of your choice.

Following industry best practices, AWS renews the CA and creates new certificates on a routine basis to ensure customer connections are properly protected for years to come. The current CA in the EU-WEST-1 Region will expire on August 22, 2024. Before this date you will need to update your DB server certificate. The following is the general process to do this:\n\nFirst, update your application clients with the new certificate, if your application client is using a trust store then add the new CA certificates into the trust stores of your client applications. RDS provides download links to the CA certificates in our User Guide [2]. For more detailed instructions on updating the trust stores on your client application see our documentation [3].\n\nSecond, update the certificate on all your affected database instances to one of the newly issued CAs. \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 is the default recommended CA because there is no algorithm change. The other CAs use new key algorithms so it could require more testing of your client setup to ensure compatibility. For more information on the new CAs see our documentation [4].\n\nThird, if you want to use a different CA than the default \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019, you will need to set an account level CA override so your new instances will use the CA of your choice. To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later. For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs. \n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 certificate. If you wish for new instances to use a different certificate, you can specify which certificate to use with the AWS console or the AWS CLI. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\n3. After August 22, 2024 - \u2018rds-ca-2019\u2019 will expire. You will need to take action before August 22, 2024, to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances.\n\nFor more information see our blog [9], and if you have questions or concerns, please contact AWS Support [10].\n\n[1] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/modify-certificates.html\n[2] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.CertificatesAllRegions\n[3] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation-updating\n[4] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.RegionCertificateAuthorities\n[5] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-certificates.html\n[6] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/create-db-instance.html\n[7] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[8] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[9] https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/rotate-your-ssl-tls-certificates-now-amazon-rds-and-amazon-aurora-expire-in-2024/\n[10] https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home",

If you believe you have already finished this work and still received this email, it is likely because you created new instances using the 2019 Certificate Authority (CA). After January 25, 2024 all newly created instances that do not explicitly specify a different CA will use the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 CA. For information on setting an account level CA override, see the modify-certificates API documentation [1].\n\nIf your applications connect to these instances using the SSL/TLS protocol, you will need to take action before August 22, 2024 to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances. Even if you do not currently use SSL for your connections, you could still be affected if your databases server certificate expires, so we still recommend updating your CA.\n\nTo protect your communications with your database instances, a CA generates time-bound certificates that are checked by your database client software to authenticate any database instance before exchanging information. Following industry best practices, AWS renews the CA and creates new certificates on a routine basis to ensure customer connections are properly protected for years to come. The current CA in the EU-WEST-1 Region will expire on August 22, 2024. Before this date you will need to update your DB server certificate. The following is the general process to do this:\n\nFirst, update your application clients with the new certificate, if your application client is using a trust store then add the new CA certificates into the trust stores of your client applications. RDS provides download links to the CA certificates in our User Guide [2]. For more detailed instructions on updating the trust stores on your client application see our documentation [3].\n\nSecond, update the certificate on all your affected database instances to one of the newly issued CAs. \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 is the default recommended CA because there is no algorithm change. The other CAs use new key algorithms so it could require more testing of your client setup to ensure compatibility. For more information on the new CAs see our documentation [4].\n\nThird, if you want to use a different CA than the default \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019, you will need to set an account level CA override so your new instances will use the CA of your choice. To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later. For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs. \n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 certificate. If you wish for new instances to use a different certificate, you can specify which certificate to use with the AWS console or the AWS CLI. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\n3. After August 22, 2024 - \u2018rds-ca-2019\u2019 will expire.

If you believe you have already finished this work and still received this email, it is likely because you created new instances using the 2019 Certificate Authority (CA). After January 25, 2024 all newly created instances that do not explicitly specify a different CA will use the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 CA. For information on setting an account level CA override, see the modify-certificates API documentation [1].\n\nIf your applications connect to these instances using the SSL/TLS protocol, you will need to take action before August 22, 2024 to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances. Even if you do not currently use SSL for your connections, you could still be affected if your databases server certificate expires, so we still recommend updating your CA.\n\nTo protect your communications with your database instances, a CA generates time-bound certificates that are checked by your database client software to authenticate any database instance before exchanging information. Following industry best practices, AWS renews the CA and creates new certificates on a routine basis to ensure customer connections are properly protected for years to come. The current CA in the EU-WEST-1 Region will expire on August 22, 2024. Before this date you will need to update your DB server certificate. The following is the general process to do this:\n\nFirst, update your application clients with the new certificate, if your application client is using a trust store then add the new CA certificates into the trust stores of your client applications. RDS provides download links to the CA certificates in our User Guide [2]. For more detailed instructions on updating the trust stores on your client application see our documentation [3].\n\nSecond, update the certificate on all your affected database instances to one of the newly issued CAs. \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 is the default recommended CA because there is no algorithm change. The other CAs use new key algorithms so it could require more testing of your client setup to ensure compatibility. For more information on the new CAs see our documentation [4].\n\nThird, if you want to use a different CA than the default \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019, you will need to set an account level CA override so your new instances will use the CA of your choice. To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later. For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs. \n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 certificate. If you wish for new instances to use a different certificate, you can specify which certificate to use with the AWS console or the AWS CLI. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\n3. After August 22, 2024 - \u2018rds-ca-2019\u2019 will expire. You will need to take action before August 22, 2024, to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances.\n\nFor more information see our blog [9], and if you have questions or concerns, please contact AWS Support [10].\n\n[1] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/modify-certificates.html\n[2] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.CertificatesAllRegions\n[3] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation-updating\n[4] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.RegionCertificateAuthorities\n[5] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-certificates.html\n[6] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/create-db-instance.html\n[7] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[8] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[9] https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/rotate-your-ssl-tls-certificates-now-amazon-rds-and-amazon-aurora-expire-in-2024/\n[10] https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home",

If you believe you have already finished this work and still received this email, it is likely because you created new instances using the 2019 Certificate Authority (CA). After January 25, 2024 all newly created instances that do not explicitly specify a different CA will use the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 CA. For information on setting an account level CA override, see the modify-certificates API documentation [1].\n\nIf your applications connect to these instances using the SSL/TLS protocol, you will need to take action before August 22, 2024 to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances. Even if you do not currently use SSL for your connections, you could still be affected if your databases server certificate expires, so we still recommend updating your CA.\n\nTo protect your communications with your database instances, a CA generates time-bound certificates that are checked by your database client software to authenticate any database instance before exchanging information. Following industry best practices, AWS renews the CA and creates new certificates on a routine basis to ensure customer connections are properly protected for years to come. The current CA in the EU-WEST-1 Region will expire on August 22, 2024. Before this date you will need to update your DB server certificate. The following is the general process to do this:\n\nFirst, update your application clients with the new certificate, if your application client is using a trust store then add the new CA certificates into the trust stores of your client applications. RDS provides download links to the CA certificates in our User Guide [2]. For more detailed instructions on updating the trust stores on your client application see our documentation [3].\n\nSecond, update the certificate on all your affected database instances to one of the newly issued CAs. \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 is the default recommended CA because there is no algorithm change. The other CAs use new key algorithms so it could require more testing of your client setup to ensure compatibility. For more information on the new CAs see our documentation [4].\n\nThird, if you want to use a different CA than the default \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019, you will need to set an account level CA override so your new instances will use the CA of your choice. To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later. For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs. \n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 certificate.

To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later. For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs. \n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 certificate. If you wish for new instances to use a different certificate, you can specify which certificate to use with the AWS console or the AWS CLI. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\n3. After August 22, 2024 - \u2018rds-ca-2019\u2019 will expire. You will need to take action before August 22, 2024, to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances.\n\nFor more information see our blog [9], and if you have questions or concerns, please contact AWS Support [10].\n\n[1] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/modify-certificates.html\n[2] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.CertificatesAllRegions\n[3] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation-updating\n[4] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.RegionCertificateAuthorities\n[5] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-certificates.html\n[6] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/create-db-instance.html\n[7] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[8] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[9] https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/rotate-your-ssl-tls-certificates-now-amazon-rds-and-amazon-aurora-expire-in-2024/\n[10] https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home",

If you believe you have already finished this work and still received this email, it is likely because you created new instances using the 2019 Certificate Authority (CA).

Even if you do not currently use SSL for your connections, you could still be affected if your databases server certificate expires, so we still recommend updating your CA.\n\nTo protect your communications with your database instances, a CA generates time-bound certificates that are checked by your database client software to authenticate any database instance before exchanging information.

The current CA in the EU-WEST-1 Region will expire on August 22, 2024. Before this date you will need to update your DB server certificate.

RDS provides download links to the CA certificates in our User Guide [2].

For information on setting an account level CA override, see the modify-certificates API documentation [1].\n\nIf your applications connect to these instances using the SSL/TLS protocol, you will need to take action before August 22, 2024 to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances. Even if you do not currently use SSL for your connections, you could still be affected if your databases server certificate expires, so we still recommend updating your CA.\n\nTo protect your communications with your database instances, a CA generates time-bound certificates that are checked by your database client software to authenticate any database instance before exchanging information. Following industry best practices, AWS renews the CA and creates new certificates on a routine basis to ensure customer connections are properly protected for years to come. The current CA in the EU-WEST-1 Region will expire on August 22, 2024. Before this date you will need to update your DB server certificate. The following is the general process to do this:\n\nFirst, update your application clients with the new certificate, if your application client is using a trust store then add the new CA certificates into the trust stores of your client applications. RDS provides download links to the CA certificates in our User Guide [2]. For more detailed instructions on updating the trust stores on your client application see our documentation [3].\n\nSecond, update the certificate on all your affected database instances to one of the newly issued CAs. \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 is the default recommended CA because there is no algorithm change. The other CAs use new key algorithms so it could require more testing of your client setup to ensure compatibility. For more information on the new CAs see our documentation [4].\n\nThird, if you want to use a different CA than the default \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019, you will need to set an account level CA override so your new instances will use the CA of your choice. To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later. For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs. \n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 certificate. If you wish for new instances to use a different certificate, you can specify which certificate to use with the AWS console or the AWS CLI. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\n3. After August 22, 2024 - \u2018rds-ca-2019\u2019 will expire. You will need to take action before August 22, 2024, to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances.\n\nFor more information see our blog [9], and if you have questions or concerns, please contact AWS Support [10].\n\n[1] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/modify-certificates.html\n[2] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.CertificatesAllRegions\n[3] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation-updating\n[4] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.RegionCertificateAuthorities\n[5] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-certificates.html\n[6] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/create-db-instance.html\n[7] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[8] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[9] https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/rotate-your-ssl-tls-certificates-now-amazon-rds-and-amazon-aurora-expire-in-2024/\n[10] https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home",

If you believe you have already finished this work and still received this email, it is likely because you created new instances using the 2019 Certificate Authority (CA). After January 25, 2024 all newly created instances that do not explicitly specify a different CA will use the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 CA. For information on setting an account level CA override, see the modify-certificates API documentation [1].\n\nIf your applications connect to these instances using the SSL/TLS protocol, you will need to take action before August 22, 2024 to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances. Even if you do not currently use SSL for your connections, you could still be affected if your databases server certificate expires, so we still recommend updating your CA.\n\nTo protect your communications with your database instances, a CA generates time-bound certificates that are checked by your database client software to authenticate any database instance before exchanging information. Following industry best practices, AWS renews the CA and creates new certificates on a routine basis to ensure customer connections are properly protected for years to come. The current CA in the EU-WEST-1 Region will expire on August 22, 2024. Before this date you will need to update your DB server certificate. The following is the general process to do this:\n\nFirst, update your application clients with the new certificate, if your application client is using a trust store then add the new CA certificates into the trust stores of your client applications. RDS provides download links to the CA certificates in our User Guide [2]. For more detailed instructions on updating the trust stores on your client application see our documentation [3].\n\nSecond, update the certificate on all your affected database instances to one of the newly issued CAs. \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 is the default recommended CA because there is no algorithm change. The other CAs use new key algorithms so it could require more testing of your client setup to ensure compatibility. For more information on the new CAs see our documentation [4].\n\nThird, if you want to use a different CA than the default \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019, you will need to set an account level CA override so your new instances will use the CA of your choice. To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later. For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs. \n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 certificate. If you wish for new instances to use a different certificate, you can specify which certificate to use with the AWS console or the AWS CLI. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\n3. After August 22, 2024 - \u2018rds-ca-2019\u2019 will expire.

If you believe you have already finished this work and still received this email, it is likely because you created new instances using the 2019 Certificate Authority (CA). After January 25, 2024 all newly created instances that do not explicitly specify a different CA will use the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 CA. For information on setting an account level CA override, see the modify-certificates API documentation [1].\n\nIf your applications connect to these instances using the SSL/TLS protocol, you will need to take action before August 22, 2024 to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances. Even if you do not currently use SSL for your connections, you could still be affected if your databases server certificate expires, so we still recommend updating your CA.\n\nTo protect your communications with your database instances, a CA generates time-bound certificates that are checked by your database client software to authenticate any database instance before exchanging information. Following industry best practices, AWS renews the CA and creates new certificates on a routine basis to ensure customer connections are properly protected for years to come. The current CA in the EU-WEST-1 Region will expire on August 22, 2024. Before this date you will need to update your DB server certificate. The following is the general process to do this:\n\nFirst, update your application clients with the new certificate, if your application client is using a trust store then add the new CA certificates into the trust stores of your client applications. RDS provides download links to the CA certificates in our User Guide [2]. For more detailed instructions on updating the trust stores on your client application see our documentation [3].\n\nSecond, update the certificate on all your affected database instances to one of the newly issued CAs. \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 is the default recommended CA because there is no algorithm change. The other CAs use new key algorithms so it could require more testing of your client setup to ensure compatibility. For more information on the new CAs see our documentation [4].\n\nThird, if you want to use a different CA than the default \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019, you will need to set an account level CA override so your new instances will use the CA of your choice. To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later. For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs. \n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 certificate. If you wish for new instances to use a different certificate, you can specify which certificate to use with the AWS console or the AWS CLI. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\n3. After August 22, 2024 - \u2018rds-ca-2019\u2019 will expire. You will need to take action before August 22, 2024, to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances.\n\nFor more information see our blog [9], and if you have questions or concerns, please contact AWS Support [10].\n\n[1] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/modify-certificates.html\n[2] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.CertificatesAllRegions\n[3] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation-updating\n[4] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.RegionCertificateAuthorities\n[5] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-certificates.html\n[6] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/create-db-instance.html\n[7] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[8] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[9] https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/rotate-your-ssl-tls-certificates-now-amazon-rds-and-amazon-aurora-expire-in-2024/\n[10] https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home",

For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs. \n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 certificate. If you wish for new instances to use a different certificate, you can specify which certificate to use with the AWS console or the AWS CLI. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\n3. After August 22, 2024 - \u2018rds-ca-2019\u2019 will expire. You will need to take action before August 22, 2024, to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances.\n\nFor more information see our blog [9], and if you have questions or concerns, please contact AWS Support [10].\n\n[1] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/modify-certificates.html\n[2] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.CertificatesAllRegions\n[3] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation-updating\n[4] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.RegionCertificateAuthorities\n[5] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-certificates.html\n[6] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/create-db-instance.html\n[7] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[8] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[9] https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/rotate-your-ssl-tls-certificates-now-amazon-rds-and-amazon-aurora-expire-in-2024/\n[10] https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home",

If you believe you have already finished this work and still received this email, it is likely because you created new instances using the 2019 Certificate Authority (CA). After January 25, 2024 all newly created instances that do not explicitly specify a different CA will use the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 CA. For information on setting an account level CA override, see the modify-certificates API documentation [1].\n\nIf your applications connect to these instances using the SSL/TLS protocol, you will need to take action before August 22, 2024 to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances. Even if you do not currently use SSL for your connections, you could still be affected if your databases server certificate expires, so we still recommend updating your CA.\n\nTo protect your communications with your database instances, a CA generates time-bound certificates that are checked by your database client software to authenticate any database instance before exchanging information. Following industry best practices, AWS renews the CA and creates new certificates on a routine basis to ensure customer connections are properly protected for years to come. The current CA in the EU-WEST-1 Region will expire on August 22, 2024. Before this date you will need to update your DB server certificate. The following is the general process to do this:\n\nFirst, update your application clients with the new certificate, if your application client is using a trust store then add the new CA certificates into the trust stores of your client applications. RDS provides download links to the CA certificates in our User Guide [2]. For more detailed instructions on updating the trust stores on your client application see our documentation [3].\n\nSecond, update the certificate on all your affected database instances to one of the newly issued CAs. \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 is the default recommended CA because there is no algorithm change. The other CAs use new key algorithms so it could require more testing of your client setup to ensure compatibility. For more information on the new CAs see our documentation [4].\n\nThird, if you want to use a different CA than the default \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019, you will need to set an account level CA override so your new instances will use the CA of your choice.

Following industry best practices, AWS renews the CA and creates new certificates on a routine basis to ensure customer connections are properly protected for years to come. The current CA in the EU-WEST-1 Region will expire on August 22, 2024. Before this date you will need to update your DB server certificate. The following is the general process to do this:\n\nFirst, update your application clients with the new certificate, if your application client is using a trust store then add the new CA certificates into the trust stores of your client applications. RDS provides download links to the CA certificates in our User Guide [2]. For more detailed instructions on updating the trust stores on your client application see our documentation [3].\n\nSecond, update the certificate on all your affected database instances to one of the newly issued CAs. \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 is the default recommended CA because there is no algorithm change. The other CAs use new key algorithms so it could require more testing of your client setup to ensure compatibility. For more information on the new CAs see our documentation [4].\n\nThird, if you want to use a different CA than the default \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019, you will need to set an account level CA override so your new instances will use the CA of your choice. To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later. For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs. \n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 certificate. If you wish for new instances to use a different certificate, you can specify which certificate to use with the AWS console or the AWS CLI. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\n3. After August 22, 2024 - \u2018rds-ca-2019\u2019 will expire. You will need to take action before August 22, 2024, to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances.\n\nFor more information see our blog [9], and if you have questions or concerns, please contact AWS Support [10].\n\n[1] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/modify-certificates.html\n[2] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.CertificatesAllRegions\n[3] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation-updating\n[4] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.RegionCertificateAuthorities\n[5] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-certificates.html\n[6] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/create-db-instance.html\n[7] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[8] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[9] https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/rotate-your-ssl-tls-certificates-now-amazon-rds-and-amazon-aurora-expire-in-2024/\n[10] https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home",

If you believe you have already finished this work and still received this email, it is likely because you created new instances using the 2019 Certificate Authority (CA). After January 25, 2024 all newly created instances that do not explicitly specify a different CA will use the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 CA. For information on setting an account level CA override, see the modify-certificates API documentation [1].\n\nIf your applications connect to these instances using the SSL/TLS protocol, you will need to take action before August 22, 2024 to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances. Even if you do not currently use SSL for your connections, you could still be affected if your databases server certificate expires, so we still recommend updating your CA.\n\nTo protect your communications with your database instances, a CA generates time-bound certificates that are checked by your database client software to authenticate any database instance before exchanging information. Following industry best practices, AWS renews the CA and creates new certificates on a routine basis to ensure customer connections are properly protected for years to come. The current CA in the EU-WEST-1 Region will expire on August 22, 2024. Before this date you will need to update your DB server certificate. The following is the general process to do this:\n\nFirst, update your application clients with the new certificate, if your application client is using a trust store then add the new CA certificates into the trust stores of your client applications. RDS provides download links to the CA certificates in our User Guide [2]. For more detailed instructions on updating the trust stores on your client application see our documentation [3].\n\nSecond, update the certificate on all your affected database instances to one of the newly issued CAs. \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 is the default recommended CA because there is no algorithm change. The other CAs use new key algorithms so it could require more testing of your client setup to ensure compatibility. For more information on the new CAs see our documentation [4].\n\nThird, if you want to use a different CA than the default \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019, you will need to set an account level CA override so your new instances will use the CA of your choice. To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later. For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs. \n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 certificate. If you wish for new instances to use a different certificate, you can specify which certificate to use with the AWS console or the AWS CLI. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\n3. After August 22, 2024 - \u2018rds-ca-2019\u2019 will expire.

If you believe you have already finished this work and still received this email, it is likely because you created new instances using the 2019 Certificate Authority (CA). After January 25, 2024 all newly created instances that do not explicitly specify a different CA will use the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 CA. For information on setting an account level CA override, see the modify-certificates API documentation [1].\n\nIf your applications connect to these instances using the SSL/TLS protocol, you will need to take action before August 22, 2024 to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances. Even if you do not currently use SSL for your connections, you could still be affected if your databases server certificate expires, so we still recommend updating your CA.\n\nTo protect your communications with your database instances, a CA generates time-bound certificates that are checked by your database client software to authenticate any database instance before exchanging information. Following industry best practices, AWS renews the CA and creates new certificates on a routine basis to ensure customer connections are properly protected for years to come. The current CA in the EU-WEST-1 Region will expire on August 22, 2024. Before this date you will need to update your DB server certificate. The following is the general process to do this:\n\nFirst, update your application clients with the new certificate, if your application client is using a trust store then add the new CA certificates into the trust stores of your client applications. RDS provides download links to the CA certificates in our User Guide [2]. For more detailed instructions on updating the trust stores on your client application see our documentation [3].\n\nSecond, update the certificate on all your affected database instances to one of the newly issued CAs. \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 is the default recommended CA because there is no algorithm change. The other CAs use new key algorithms so it could require more testing of your client setup to ensure compatibility. For more information on the new CAs see our documentation [4].\n\nThird, if you want to use a different CA than the default \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019, you will need to set an account level CA override so your new instances will use the CA of your choice. To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later. For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs. \n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 certificate. If you wish for new instances to use a different certificate, you can specify which certificate to use with the AWS console or the AWS CLI. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\n3. After August 22, 2024 - \u2018rds-ca-2019\u2019 will expire. You will need to take action before August 22, 2024, to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances.\n\nFor more information see our blog [9], and if you have questions or concerns, please contact AWS Support [10].\n\n[1] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/modify-certificates.html\n[2] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.CertificatesAllRegions\n[3] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation-updating\n[4] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.RegionCertificateAuthorities\n[5] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-certificates.html\n[6] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/create-db-instance.html\n[7] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[8] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[9] https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/rotate-your-ssl-tls-certificates-now-amazon-rds-and-amazon-aurora-expire-in-2024/\n[10] https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home",

If you believe you have already finished this work and still received this email, it is likely because you created new instances using the 2019 Certificate Authority (CA). After January 25, 2024 all newly created instances that do not explicitly specify a different CA will use the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 CA. For information on setting an account level CA override, see the modify-certificates API documentation [1].\n\nIf your applications connect to these instances using the SSL/TLS protocol, you will need to take action before August 22, 2024 to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances. Even if you do not currently use SSL for your connections, you could still be affected if your databases server certificate expires, so we still recommend updating your CA.\n\nTo protect your communications with your database instances, a CA generates time-bound certificates that are checked by your database client software to authenticate any database instance before exchanging information. Following industry best practices, AWS renews the CA and creates new certificates on a routine basis to ensure customer connections are properly protected for years to come. The current CA in the EU-WEST-1 Region will expire on August 22, 2024. Before this date you will need to update your DB server certificate. The following is the general process to do this:\n\nFirst, update your application clients with the new certificate, if your application client is using a trust store then add the new CA certificates into the trust stores of your client applications. RDS provides download links to the CA certificates in our User Guide [2]. For more detailed instructions on updating the trust stores on your client application see our documentation [3].\n\nSecond, update the certificate on all your affected database instances to one of the newly issued CAs. \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 is the default recommended CA because there is no algorithm change. The other CAs use new key algorithms so it could require more testing of your client setup to ensure compatibility. For more information on the new CAs see our documentation [4].\n\nThird, if you want to use a different CA than the default \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019, you will need to set an account level CA override so your new instances will use the CA of your choice. To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later. For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs. \n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 certificate. If you wish for new instances to use a different certificate, you can specify which certificate to use with the AWS console or the AWS CLI. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\n3. After August 22, 2024 - \u2018rds-ca-2019\u2019 will expire.

For more information on the new CAs see our documentation [4].\n\nThird, if you want to use a different CA than the default \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019, you will need to set an account level CA override so your new instances will use the CA of your choice. To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later. For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs. \n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 certificate. If you wish for new instances to use a different certificate, you can specify which certificate to use with the AWS console or the AWS CLI. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\n3. After August 22, 2024 - \u2018rds-ca-2019\u2019 will expire. You will need to take action before August 22, 2024, to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances.\n\nFor more information see our blog [9], and if you have questions or concerns, please contact AWS Support [10].\n\n[1] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/modify-certificates.html\n[2] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.CertificatesAllRegions\n[3] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation-updating\n[4] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.RegionCertificateAuthorities\n[5] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-certificates.html\n[6] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/create-db-instance.html\n[7] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[8] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[9] https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/rotate-your-ssl-tls-certificates-now-amazon-rds-and-amazon-aurora-expire-in-2024/\n[10] https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home",

After January 25, 2024 all newly created instances that do not explicitly specify a different CA will use the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 CA. For information on setting an account level CA override, see the modify-certificates API documentation [1].\n\nIf your applications connect to these instances using the SSL/TLS protocol, you will need to take action before August 22, 2024 to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances. Even if you do not currently use SSL for your connections, you could still be affected if your databases server certificate expires, so we still recommend updating your CA.\n\nTo protect your communications with your database instances, a CA generates time-bound certificates that are checked by your database client software to authenticate any database instance before exchanging information. Following industry best practices, AWS renews the CA and creates new certificates on a routine basis to ensure customer connections are properly protected for years to come. The current CA in the EU-WEST-1 Region will expire on August 22, 2024. Before this date you will need to update your DB server certificate. The following is the general process to do this:\n\nFirst, update your application clients with the new certificate, if your application client is using a trust store then add the new CA certificates into the trust stores of your client applications. RDS provides download links to the CA certificates in our User Guide [2]. For more detailed instructions on updating the trust stores on your client application see our documentation [3].\n\nSecond, update the certificate on all your affected database instances to one of the newly issued CAs. \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 is the default recommended CA because there is no algorithm change. The other CAs use new key algorithms so it could require more testing of your client setup to ensure compatibility. For more information on the new CAs see our documentation [4].\n\nThird, if you want to use a different CA than the default \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019, you will need to set an account level CA override so your new instances will use the CA of your choice. To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later. For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs. \n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 certificate. If you wish for new instances to use a different certificate, you can specify which certificate to use with the AWS console or the AWS CLI. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\n3. After August 22, 2024 - \u2018rds-ca-2019\u2019 will expire.

If you believe you have already finished this work and still received this email, it is likely because you created new instances using the 2019 Certificate Authority (CA). After January 25, 2024 all newly created instances that do not explicitly specify a different CA will use the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 CA. For information on setting an account level CA override, see the modify-certificates API documentation [1].\n\nIf your applications connect to these instances using the SSL/TLS protocol, you will need to take action before August 22, 2024 to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances. Even if you do not currently use SSL for your connections, you could still be affected if your databases server certificate expires, so we still recommend updating your CA.\n\nTo protect your communications with your database instances, a CA generates time-bound certificates that are checked by your database client software to authenticate any database instance before exchanging information. Following industry best practices, AWS renews the CA and creates new certificates on a routine basis to ensure customer connections are properly protected for years to come. The current CA in the EU-WEST-1 Region will expire on August 22, 2024. Before this date you will need to update your DB server certificate. The following is the general process to do this:\n\nFirst, update your application clients with the new certificate, if your application client is using a trust store then add the new CA certificates into the trust stores of your client applications. RDS provides download links to the CA certificates in our User Guide [2]. For more detailed instructions on updating the trust stores on your client application see our documentation [3].\n\nSecond, update the certificate on all your affected database instances to one of the newly issued CAs. \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 is the default recommended CA because there is no algorithm change. The other CAs use new key algorithms so it could require more testing of your client setup to ensure compatibility. For more information on the new CAs see our documentation [4].\n\nThird, if you want to use a different CA than the default \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019, you will need to set an account level CA override so your new instances will use the CA of your choice. To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later. For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs. \n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 certificate. If you wish for new instances to use a different certificate, you can specify which certificate to use with the AWS console or the AWS CLI. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\n3. After August 22, 2024 - \u2018rds-ca-2019\u2019 will expire. You will need to take action before August 22, 2024, to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances.\n\nFor more information see our blog [9], and if you have questions or concerns, please contact AWS Support [10].\n\n[1] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/modify-certificates.html\n[2] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.CertificatesAllRegions\n[3] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation-updating\n[4] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.RegionCertificateAuthorities\n[5] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-certificates.html\n[6] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/create-db-instance.html\n[7] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[8] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[9] https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/rotate-your-ssl-tls-certificates-now-amazon-rds-and-amazon-aurora-expire-in-2024/\n[10] https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home",

If you believe you have already finished this work and still received this email, it is likely because you created new instances using the 2019 Certificate Authority (CA). After January 25, 2024 all newly created instances that do not explicitly specify a different CA will use the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 CA. For information on setting an account level CA override, see the modify-certificates API documentation [1].\n\nIf your applications connect to these instances using the SSL/TLS protocol, you will need to take action before August 22, 2024 to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances. Even if you do not currently use SSL for your connections, you could still be affected if your databases server certificate expires, so we still recommend updating your CA.\n\nTo protect your communications with your database instances, a CA generates time-bound certificates that are checked by your database client software to authenticate any database instance before exchanging information. Following industry best practices, AWS renews the CA and creates new certificates on a routine basis to ensure customer connections are properly protected for years to come. The current CA in the EU-WEST-1 Region will expire on August 22, 2024. Before this date you will need to update your DB server certificate. The following is the general process to do this:\n\nFirst, update your application clients with the new certificate, if your application client is using a trust store then add the new CA certificates into the trust stores of your client applications. RDS provides download links to the CA certificates in our User Guide [2]. For more detailed instructions on updating the trust stores on your client application see our documentation [3].\n\nSecond, update the certificate on all your affected database instances to one of the newly issued CAs. \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 is the default recommended CA because there is no algorithm change. The other CAs use new key algorithms so it could require more testing of your client setup to ensure compatibility. For more information on the new CAs see our documentation [4].\n\nThird, if you want to use a different CA than the default \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019, you will need to set an account level CA override so your new instances will use the CA of your choice. To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later. For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs. \n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 certificate. If you wish for new instances to use a different certificate, you can specify which certificate to use with the AWS console or the AWS CLI. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\n3. After August 22, 2024 - \u2018rds-ca-2019\u2019 will expire.

For more information on the new CAs see our documentation [4].\n\nThird, if you want to use a different CA than the default \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019, you will need to set an account level CA override so your new instances will use the CA of your choice. To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later. For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs. \n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 certificate. If you wish for new instances to use a different certificate, you can specify which certificate to use with the AWS console or the AWS CLI. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\n3. After August 22, 2024 - \u2018rds-ca-2019\u2019 will expire. You will need to take action before August 22, 2024, to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances.\n\nFor more information see our blog [9], and if you have questions or concerns, please contact AWS Support [10].\n\n[1] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/modify-certificates.html\n[2] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.CertificatesAllRegions\n[3] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation-updating\n[4] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.RegionCertificateAuthorities\n[5] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-certificates.html\n[6] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/create-db-instance.html\n[7] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[8] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[9] https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/rotate-your-ssl-tls-certificates-now-amazon-rds-and-amazon-aurora-expire-in-2024/\n[10] https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home",

After January 25, 2024 all newly created instances that do not explicitly specify a different CA will use the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 CA. For information on setting an account level CA override, see the modify-certificates API documentation [1].\n\nIf your applications connect to these instances using the SSL/TLS protocol, you will need to take action before August 22, 2024 to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances. Even if you do not currently use SSL for your connections, you could still be affected if your databases server certificate expires, so we still recommend updating your CA.\n\nTo protect your communications with your database instances, a CA generates time-bound certificates that are checked by your database client software to authenticate any database instance before exchanging information. Following industry best practices, AWS renews the CA and creates new certificates on a routine basis to ensure customer connections are properly protected for years to come. The current CA in the EU-WEST-1 Region will expire on August 22, 2024. Before this date you will need to update your DB server certificate. The following is the general process to do this:\n\nFirst, update your application clients with the new certificate, if your application client is using a trust store then add the new CA certificates into the trust stores of your client applications. RDS provides download links to the CA certificates in our User Guide [2]. For more detailed instructions on updating the trust stores on your client application see our documentation [3].\n\nSecond, update the certificate on all your affected database instances to one of the newly issued CAs. \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 is the default recommended CA because there is no algorithm change. The other CAs use new key algorithms so it could require more testing of your client setup to ensure compatibility. For more information on the new CAs see our documentation [4].\n\nThird, if you want to use a different CA than the default \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019, you will need to set an account level CA override so your new instances will use the CA of your choice. To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later. For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs. \n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 certificate. If you wish for new instances to use a different certificate, you can specify which certificate to use with the AWS console or the AWS CLI. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\n3. After August 22, 2024 - \u2018rds-ca-2019\u2019 will expire.

If you believe you have already finished this work and still received this email, it is likely because you created new instances using the 2019 Certificate Authority (CA). After January 25, 2024 all newly created instances that do not explicitly specify a different CA will use the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 CA. For information on setting an account level CA override, see the modify-certificates API documentation [1].\n\nIf your applications connect to these instances using the SSL/TLS protocol, you will need to take action before August 22, 2024 to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances. Even if you do not currently use SSL for your connections, you could still be affected if your databases server certificate expires, so we still recommend updating your CA.\n\nTo protect your communications with your database instances, a CA generates time-bound certificates that are checked by your database client software to authenticate any database instance before exchanging information. Following industry best practices, AWS renews the CA and creates new certificates on a routine basis to ensure customer connections are properly protected for years to come. The current CA in the EU-WEST-1 Region will expire on August 22, 2024. Before this date you will need to update your DB server certificate. The following is the general process to do this:\n\nFirst, update your application clients with the new certificate, if your application client is using a trust store then add the new CA certificates into the trust stores of your client applications. RDS provides download links to the CA certificates in our User Guide [2]. For more detailed instructions on updating the trust stores on your client application see our documentation [3].\n\nSecond, update the certificate on all your affected database instances to one of the newly issued CAs. \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 is the default recommended CA because there is no algorithm change. The other CAs use new key algorithms so it could require more testing of your client setup to ensure compatibility. For more information on the new CAs see our documentation [4].\n\nThird, if you want to use a different CA than the default \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019, you will need to set an account level CA override so your new instances will use the CA of your choice. To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later. For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs. \n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 certificate. If you wish for new instances to use a different certificate, you can specify which certificate to use with the AWS console or the AWS CLI. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\n3. After August 22, 2024 - \u2018rds-ca-2019\u2019 will expire. You will need to take action before August 22, 2024, to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances.\n\nFor more information see our blog [9], and if you have questions or concerns, please contact AWS Support [10].\n\n[1] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/modify-certificates.html\n[2] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.CertificatesAllRegions\n[3] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation-updating\n[4] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.RegionCertificateAuthorities\n[5] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-certificates.html\n[6] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/create-db-instance.html\n[7] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[8] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[9] https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/rotate-your-ssl-tls-certificates-now-amazon-rds-and-amazon-aurora-expire-in-2024/\n[10] https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home",

If you believe you have already finished this work and still received this email, it is likely because you created new instances using the 2019 Certificate Authority (CA). After January 25, 2024 all newly created instances that do not explicitly specify a different CA will use the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 CA. For information on setting an account level CA override, see the modify-certificates API documentation [1].\n\nIf your applications connect to these instances using the SSL/TLS protocol, you will need to take action before August 22, 2024 to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances. Even if you do not currently use SSL for your connections, you could still be affected if your databases server certificate expires, so we still recommend updating your CA.\n\nTo protect your communications with your database instances, a CA generates time-bound certificates that are checked by your database client software to authenticate any database instance before exchanging information. Following industry best practices, AWS renews the CA and creates new certificates on a routine basis to ensure customer connections are properly protected for years to come. The current CA in the EU-WEST-1 Region will expire on August 22, 2024. Before this date you will need to update your DB server certificate. The following is the general process to do this:\n\nFirst, update your application clients with the new certificate, if your application client is using a trust store then add the new CA certificates into the trust stores of your client applications. RDS provides download links to the CA certificates in our User Guide [2]. For more detailed instructions on updating the trust stores on your client application see our documentation [3].\n\nSecond, update the certificate on all your affected database instances to one of the newly issued CAs. \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 is the default recommended CA because there is no algorithm change. The other CAs use new key algorithms so it could require more testing of your client setup to ensure compatibility. For more information on the new CAs see our documentation [4].\n\nThird, if you want to use a different CA than the default \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019, you will need to set an account level CA override so your new instances will use the CA of your choice. To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later. For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs. \n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 certificate. If you wish for new instances to use a different certificate, you can specify which certificate to use with the AWS console or the AWS CLI. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\n3. After August 22, 2024 - \u2018rds-ca-2019\u2019 will expire.

For more information on the new CAs see our documentation [4].\n\nThird, if you want to use a different CA than the default \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019, you will need to set an account level CA override so your new instances will use the CA of your choice. To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later. For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs. \n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 certificate. If you wish for new instances to use a different certificate, you can specify which certificate to use with the AWS console or the AWS CLI. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\n3. After August 22, 2024 - \u2018rds-ca-2019\u2019 will expire. You will need to take action before August 22, 2024, to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances.\n\nFor more information see our blog [9], and if you have questions or concerns, please contact AWS Support [10].\n\n[1] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/modify-certificates.html\n[2] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.CertificatesAllRegions\n[3] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation-updating\n[4] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.RegionCertificateAuthorities\n[5] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-certificates.html\n[6] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/create-db-instance.html\n[7] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[8] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[9] https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/rotate-your-ssl-tls-certificates-now-amazon-rds-and-amazon-aurora-expire-in-2024/\n[10] https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home",

After January 25, 2024 all newly created instances that do not explicitly specify a different CA will use the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 CA. For information on setting an account level CA override, see the modify-certificates API documentation [1].\n\nIf your applications connect to these instances using the SSL/TLS protocol, you will need to take action before August 22, 2024 to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances. Even if you do not currently use SSL for your connections, you could still be affected if your databases server certificate expires, so we still recommend updating your CA.\n\nTo protect your communications with your database instances, a CA generates time-bound certificates that are checked by your database client software to authenticate any database instance before exchanging information. Following industry best practices, AWS renews the CA and creates new certificates on a routine basis to ensure customer connections are properly protected for years to come. The current CA in the EU-WEST-1 Region will expire on August 22, 2024. Before this date you will need to update your DB server certificate. The following is the general process to do this:\n\nFirst, update your application clients with the new certificate, if your application client is using a trust store then add the new CA certificates into the trust stores of your client applications. RDS provides download links to the CA certificates in our User Guide [2]. For more detailed instructions on updating the trust stores on your client application see our documentation [3].\n\nSecond, update the certificate on all your affected database instances to one of the newly issued CAs. \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 is the default recommended CA because there is no algorithm change. The other CAs use new key algorithms so it could require more testing of your client setup to ensure compatibility. For more information on the new CAs see our documentation [4].\n\nThird, if you want to use a different CA than the default \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019, you will need to set an account level CA override so your new instances will use the CA of your choice. To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later. For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs. \n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 certificate. If you wish for new instances to use a different certificate, you can specify which certificate to use with the AWS console or the AWS CLI. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\n3. After August 22, 2024 - \u2018rds-ca-2019\u2019 will expire.

If you believe you have already finished this work and still received this email, it is likely because you created new instances using the 2019 Certificate Authority (CA). After January 25, 2024 all newly created instances that do not explicitly specify a different CA will use the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 CA. For information on setting an account level CA override, see the modify-certificates API documentation [1].\n\nIf your applications connect to these instances using the SSL/TLS protocol, you will need to take action before August 22, 2024 to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances. Even if you do not currently use SSL for your connections, you could still be affected if your databases server certificate expires, so we still recommend updating your CA.\n\nTo protect your communications with your database instances, a CA generates time-bound certificates that are checked by your database client software to authenticate any database instance before exchanging information. Following industry best practices, AWS renews the CA and creates new certificates on a routine basis to ensure customer connections are properly protected for years to come. The current CA in the EU-WEST-1 Region will expire on August 22, 2024. Before this date you will need to update your DB server certificate. The following is the general process to do this:\n\nFirst, update your application clients with the new certificate, if your application client is using a trust store then add the new CA certificates into the trust stores of your client applications. RDS provides download links to the CA certificates in our User Guide [2]. For more detailed instructions on updating the trust stores on your client application see our documentation [3].\n\nSecond, update the certificate on all your affected database instances to one of the newly issued CAs. \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 is the default recommended CA because there is no algorithm change. The other CAs use new key algorithms so it could require more testing of your client setup to ensure compatibility. For more information on the new CAs see our documentation [4].\n\nThird, if you want to use a different CA than the default \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019, you will need to set an account level CA override so your new instances will use the CA of your choice. To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later. For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs. \n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 certificate. If you wish for new instances to use a different certificate, you can specify which certificate to use with the AWS console or the AWS CLI. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\n3. After August 22, 2024 - \u2018rds-ca-2019\u2019 will expire. You will need to take action before August 22, 2024, to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances.\n\nFor more information see our blog [9], and if you have questions or concerns, please contact AWS Support [10].\n\n[1] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/modify-certificates.html\n[2] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.CertificatesAllRegions\n[3] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation-updating\n[4] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.RegionCertificateAuthorities\n[5] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-certificates.html\n[6] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/create-db-instance.html\n[7] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[8] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[9] https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/rotate-your-ssl-tls-certificates-now-amazon-rds-and-amazon-aurora-expire-in-2024/\n[10] https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home",

If you believe you have already finished this work and still received this email, it is likely because you created new instances using the 2019 Certificate Authority (CA). After January 25, 2024 all newly created instances that do not explicitly specify a different CA will use the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 CA. For information on setting an account level CA override, see the modify-certificates API documentation [1].\n\nIf your applications connect to these instances using the SSL/TLS protocol, you will need to take action before August 22, 2024 to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances. Even if you do not currently use SSL for your connections, you could still be affected if your databases server certificate expires, so we still recommend updating your CA.\n\nTo protect your communications with your database instances, a CA generates time-bound certificates that are checked by your database client software to authenticate any database instance before exchanging information. Following industry best practices, AWS renews the CA and creates new certificates on a routine basis to ensure customer connections are properly protected for years to come. The current CA in the EU-WEST-1 Region will expire on August 22, 2024. Before this date you will need to update your DB server certificate. The following is the general process to do this:\n\nFirst, update your application clients with the new certificate, if your application client is using a trust store then add the new CA certificates into the trust stores of your client applications. RDS provides download links to the CA certificates in our User Guide [2]. For more detailed instructions on updating the trust stores on your client application see our documentation [3].\n\nSecond, update the certificate on all your affected database instances to one of the newly issued CAs. \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 is the default recommended CA because there is no algorithm change. The other CAs use new key algorithms so it could require more testing of your client setup to ensure compatibility. For more information on the new CAs see our documentation [4].\n\nThird, if you want to use a different CA than the default \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019, you will need to set an account level CA override so your new instances will use the CA of your choice. To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later. For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs. \n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 certificate.

For more information on the new CAs see our documentation [4].\n\nThird, if you want to use a different CA than the default \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019, you will need to set an account level CA override so your new instances will use the CA of your choice. To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later. For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs. \n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 certificate. If you wish for new instances to use a different certificate, you can specify which certificate to use with the AWS console or the AWS CLI. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\n3. After August 22, 2024 - \u2018rds-ca-2019\u2019 will expire. You will need to take action before August 22, 2024, to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances.\n\nFor more information see our blog [9], and if you have questions or concerns, please contact AWS Support [10].\n\n[1] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/modify-certificates.html\n[2] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.CertificatesAllRegions\n[3] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation-updating\n[4] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.RegionCertificateAuthorities\n[5] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-certificates.html\n[6] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/create-db-instance.html\n[7] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[8] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[9] https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/rotate-your-ssl-tls-certificates-now-amazon-rds-and-amazon-aurora-expire-in-2024/\n[10] https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home",

If you believe you have already finished this work and still received this email, it is likely because you created new instances using the 2019 Certificate Authority (CA).

Even if you do not currently use SSL for your connections, you could still be affected if your databases server certificate expires, so we still recommend updating your CA.\n\nTo protect your communications with your database instances, a CA generates time-bound certificates that are checked by your database client software to authenticate any database instance before exchanging information.

The current CA in the EU-WEST-1 Region will expire on August 22, 2024. Before this date you will need to update your DB server certificate. The following is the general process to do this:\n\nFirst, update your application clients with the new certificate, if your application client is using a trust store then add the new CA certificates into the trust stores of your client applications. RDS provides download links to the CA certificates in our User Guide [2].

If you believe you have already finished this work and still received this email, it is likely because you created new instances using the 2019 Certificate Authority (CA). After January 25, 2024 all newly created instances that do not explicitly specify a different CA will use the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 CA. For information on setting an account level CA override, see the modify-certificates API documentation [1].\n\nIf your applications connect to these instances using the SSL/TLS protocol, you will need to take action before August 22, 2024 to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances. Even if you do not currently use SSL for your connections, you could still be affected if your databases server certificate expires, so we still recommend updating your CA.\n\nTo protect your communications with your database instances, a CA generates time-bound certificates that are checked by your database client software to authenticate any database instance before exchanging information. Following industry best practices, AWS renews the CA and creates new certificates on a routine basis to ensure customer connections are properly protected for years to come. The current CA in the EU-WEST-1 Region will expire on August 22, 2024. Before this date you will need to update your DB server certificate. The following is the general process to do this:\n\nFirst, update your application clients with the new certificate, if your application client is using a trust store then add the new CA certificates into the trust stores of your client applications. RDS provides download links to the CA certificates in our User Guide [2]. For more detailed instructions on updating the trust stores on your client application see our documentation [3].\n\nSecond, update the certificate on all your affected database instances to one of the newly issued CAs. \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 is the default recommended CA because there is no algorithm change. The other CAs use new key algorithms so it could require more testing of your client setup to ensure compatibility. For more information on the new CAs see our documentation [4].\n\nThird, if you want to use a different CA than the default \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019, you will need to set an account level CA override so your new instances will use the CA of your choice. To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later. For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs. \n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 certificate. If you wish for new instances to use a different certificate, you can specify which certificate to use with the AWS console or the AWS CLI. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\n3. After August 22, 2024 - \u2018rds-ca-2019\u2019 will expire.

If you believe you have already finished this work and still received this email, it is likely because you created new instances using the 2019 Certificate Authority (CA). After January 25, 2024 all newly created instances that do not explicitly specify a different CA will use the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 CA. For information on setting an account level CA override, see the modify-certificates API documentation [1].\n\nIf your applications connect to these instances using the SSL/TLS protocol, you will need to take action before August 22, 2024 to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances. Even if you do not currently use SSL for your connections, you could still be affected if your databases server certificate expires, so we still recommend updating your CA.\n\nTo protect your communications with your database instances, a CA generates time-bound certificates that are checked by your database client software to authenticate any database instance before exchanging information. Following industry best practices, AWS renews the CA and creates new certificates on a routine basis to ensure customer connections are properly protected for years to come. The current CA in the EU-WEST-1 Region will expire on August 22, 2024. Before this date you will need to update your DB server certificate. The following is the general process to do this:\n\nFirst, update your application clients with the new certificate, if your application client is using a trust store then add the new CA certificates into the trust stores of your client applications. RDS provides download links to the CA certificates in our User Guide [2]. For more detailed instructions on updating the trust stores on your client application see our documentation [3].\n\nSecond, update the certificate on all your affected database instances to one of the newly issued CAs. \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 is the default recommended CA because there is no algorithm change. The other CAs use new key algorithms so it could require more testing of your client setup to ensure compatibility. For more information on the new CAs see our documentation [4].\n\nThird, if you want to use a different CA than the default \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019, you will need to set an account level CA override so your new instances will use the CA of your choice. To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later. For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs. \n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 certificate. If you wish for new instances to use a different certificate, you can specify which certificate to use with the AWS console or the AWS CLI. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\n3. After August 22, 2024 - \u2018rds-ca-2019\u2019 will expire. You will need to take action before August 22, 2024, to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances.\n\nFor more information see our blog [9], and if you have questions or concerns, please contact AWS Support [10].\n\n[1] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/modify-certificates.html\n[2] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.CertificatesAllRegions\n[3] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation-updating\n[4] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.RegionCertificateAuthorities\n[5] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-certificates.html\n[6] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/create-db-instance.html\n[7] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[8] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[9] https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/rotate-your-ssl-tls-certificates-now-amazon-rds-and-amazon-aurora-expire-in-2024/\n[10] https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home",

If you believe you have already finished this work and still received this email, it is likely because you created new instances using the 2019 Certificate Authority (CA). After January 25, 2024 all newly created instances that do not explicitly specify a different CA will use the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 CA. For information on setting an account level CA override, see the modify-certificates API documentation [1].\n\nIf your applications connect to these instances using the SSL/TLS protocol, you will need to take action before August 22, 2024 to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances. Even if you do not currently use SSL for your connections, you could still be affected if your databases server certificate expires, so we still recommend updating your CA.\n\nTo protect your communications with your database instances, a CA generates time-bound certificates that are checked by your database client software to authenticate any database instance before exchanging information. Following industry best practices, AWS renews the CA and creates new certificates on a routine basis to ensure customer connections are properly protected for years to come. The current CA in the EU-WEST-1 Region will expire on August 22, 2024. Before this date you will need to update your DB server certificate. The following is the general process to do this:\n\nFirst, update your application clients with the new certificate, if your application client is using a trust store then add the new CA certificates into the trust stores of your client applications. RDS provides download links to the CA certificates in our User Guide [2]. For more detailed instructions on updating the trust stores on your client application see our documentation [3].\n\nSecond, update the certificate on all your affected database instances to one of the newly issued CAs. \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 is the default recommended CA because there is no algorithm change. The other CAs use new key algorithms so it could require more testing of your client setup to ensure compatibility. For more information on the new CAs see our documentation [4].\n\nThird, if you want to use a different CA than the default \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019, you will need to set an account level CA override so your new instances will use the CA of your choice. To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later. For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs. \n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 certificate. If you wish for new instances to use a different certificate, you can specify which certificate to use with the AWS console or the AWS CLI. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\n3. After August 22, 2024 - \u2018rds-ca-2019\u2019 will expire.

For more information on the new CAs see our documentation [4].\n\nThird, if you want to use a different CA than the default \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019, you will need to set an account level CA override so your new instances will use the CA of your choice. To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later. For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs. \n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 certificate. If you wish for new instances to use a different certificate, you can specify which certificate to use with the AWS console or the AWS CLI. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\n3. After August 22, 2024 - \u2018rds-ca-2019\u2019 will expire. You will need to take action before August 22, 2024, to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances.\n\nFor more information see our blog [9], and if you have questions or concerns, please contact AWS Support [10].\n\n[1] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/modify-certificates.html\n[2] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.CertificatesAllRegions\n[3] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation-updating\n[4] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.RegionCertificateAuthorities\n[5] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-certificates.html\n[6] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/create-db-instance.html\n[7] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[8] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[9] https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/rotate-your-ssl-tls-certificates-now-amazon-rds-and-amazon-aurora-expire-in-2024/\n[10] https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home",

After January 25, 2024 all newly created instances that do not explicitly specify a different CA will use the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 CA. For information on setting an account level CA override, see the modify-certificates API documentation [1].\n\nIf your applications connect to these instances using the SSL/TLS protocol, you will need to take action before August 22, 2024 to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances. Even if you do not currently use SSL for your connections, you could still be affected if your databases server certificate expires, so we still recommend updating your CA.\n\nTo protect your communications with your database instances, a CA generates time-bound certificates that are checked by your database client software to authenticate any database instance before exchanging information. Following industry best practices, AWS renews the CA and creates new certificates on a routine basis to ensure customer connections are properly protected for years to come. The current CA in the EU-WEST-1 Region will expire on August 22, 2024. Before this date you will need to update your DB server certificate. The following is the general process to do this:\n\nFirst, update your application clients with the new certificate, if your application client is using a trust store then add the new CA certificates into the trust stores of your client applications. RDS provides download links to the CA certificates in our User Guide [2]. For more detailed instructions on updating the trust stores on your client application see our documentation [3].\n\nSecond, update the certificate on all your affected database instances to one of the newly issued CAs. \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 is the default recommended CA because there is no algorithm change. The other CAs use new key algorithms so it could require more testing of your client setup to ensure compatibility. For more information on the new CAs see our documentation [4].\n\nThird, if you want to use a different CA than the default \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019, you will need to set an account level CA override so your new instances will use the CA of your choice. To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later. For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs. \n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 certificate. If you wish for new instances to use a different certificate, you can specify which certificate to use with the AWS console or the AWS CLI. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\n3. After August 22, 2024 - \u2018rds-ca-2019\u2019 will expire.

If you believe you have already finished this work and still received this email, it is likely because you created new instances using the 2019 Certificate Authority (CA). After January 25, 2024 all newly created instances that do not explicitly specify a different CA will use the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 CA. For information on setting an account level CA override, see the modify-certificates API documentation [1].\n\nIf your applications connect to these instances using the SSL/TLS protocol, you will need to take action before August 22, 2024 to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances. Even if you do not currently use SSL for your connections, you could still be affected if your databases server certificate expires, so we still recommend updating your CA.\n\nTo protect your communications with your database instances, a CA generates time-bound certificates that are checked by your database client software to authenticate any database instance before exchanging information. Following industry best practices, AWS renews the CA and creates new certificates on a routine basis to ensure customer connections are properly protected for years to come. The current CA in the EU-WEST-1 Region will expire on August 22, 2024. Before this date you will need to update your DB server certificate. The following is the general process to do this:\n\nFirst, update your application clients with the new certificate, if your application client is using a trust store then add the new CA certificates into the trust stores of your client applications. RDS provides download links to the CA certificates in our User Guide [2]. For more detailed instructions on updating the trust stores on your client application see our documentation [3].\n\nSecond, update the certificate on all your affected database instances to one of the newly issued CAs. \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 is the default recommended CA because there is no algorithm change. The other CAs use new key algorithms so it could require more testing of your client setup to ensure compatibility. For more information on the new CAs see our documentation [4].\n\nThird, if you want to use a different CA than the default \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019, you will need to set an account level CA override so your new instances will use the CA of your choice. To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later. For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs. \n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 certificate. If you wish for new instances to use a different certificate, you can specify which certificate to use with the AWS console or the AWS CLI. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\n3. After August 22, 2024 - \u2018rds-ca-2019\u2019 will expire. You will need to take action before August 22, 2024, to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances.\n\nFor more information see our blog [9], and if you have questions or concerns, please contact AWS Support [10].\n\n[1] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/modify-certificates.html\n[2] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.CertificatesAllRegions\n[3] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation-updating\n[4] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.RegionCertificateAuthorities\n[5] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-certificates.html\n[6] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/create-db-instance.html\n[7] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[8] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[9] https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/rotate-your-ssl-tls-certificates-now-amazon-rds-and-amazon-aurora-expire-in-2024/\n[10] https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home",

If you believe you have already finished this work and still received this email, it is likely because you created new instances using the 2019 Certificate Authority (CA). After January 25, 2024 all newly created instances that do not explicitly specify a different CA will use the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 CA. For information on setting an account level CA override, see the modify-certificates API documentation [1].\n\nIf your applications connect to these instances using the SSL/TLS protocol, you will need to take action before August 22, 2024 to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances. Even if you do not currently use SSL for your connections, you could still be affected if your databases server certificate expires, so we still recommend updating your CA.\n\nTo protect your communications with your database instances, a CA generates time-bound certificates that are checked by your database client software to authenticate any database instance before exchanging information. Following industry best practices, AWS renews the CA and creates new certificates on a routine basis to ensure customer connections are properly protected for years to come. The current CA in the EU-WEST-1 Region will expire on August 22, 2024. Before this date you will need to update your DB server certificate. The following is the general process to do this:\n\nFirst, update your application clients with the new certificate, if your application client is using a trust store then add the new CA certificates into the trust stores of your client applications. RDS provides download links to the CA certificates in our User Guide [2]. For more detailed instructions on updating the trust stores on your client application see our documentation [3].\n\nSecond, update the certificate on all your affected database instances to one of the newly issued CAs. \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 is the default recommended CA because there is no algorithm change. The other CAs use new key algorithms so it could require more testing of your client setup to ensure compatibility. For more information on the new CAs see our documentation [4].\n\nThird, if you want to use a different CA than the default \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019, you will need to set an account level CA override so your new instances will use the CA of your choice. To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later. For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs. \n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 certificate. If you wish for new instances to use a different certificate, you can specify which certificate to use with the AWS console or the AWS CLI. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\n3. After August 22, 2024 - \u2018rds-ca-2019\u2019 will expire.

For more information on the new CAs see our documentation [4].\n\nThird, if you want to use a different CA than the default \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019, you will need to set an account level CA override so your new instances will use the CA of your choice. To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later. For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs. \n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 certificate. If you wish for new instances to use a different certificate, you can specify which certificate to use with the AWS console or the AWS CLI. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\n3. After August 22, 2024 - \u2018rds-ca-2019\u2019 will expire. You will need to take action before August 22, 2024, to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances.\n\nFor more information see our blog [9], and if you have questions or concerns, please contact AWS Support [10].\n\n[1] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/modify-certificates.html\n[2] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.CertificatesAllRegions\n[3] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation-updating\n[4] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.RegionCertificateAuthorities\n[5] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-certificates.html\n[6] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/create-db-instance.html\n[7] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[8] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[9] https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/rotate-your-ssl-tls-certificates-now-amazon-rds-and-amazon-aurora-expire-in-2024/\n[10] https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home",

After January 25, 2024 all newly created instances that do not explicitly specify a different CA will use the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 CA. For information on setting an account level CA override, see the modify-certificates API documentation [1].\n\nIf your applications connect to these instances using the SSL/TLS protocol, you will need to take action before August 22, 2024 to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances. Even if you do not currently use SSL for your connections, you could still be affected if your databases server certificate expires, so we still recommend updating your CA.\n\nTo protect your communications with your database instances, a CA generates time-bound certificates that are checked by your database client software to authenticate any database instance before exchanging information. Following industry best practices, AWS renews the CA and creates new certificates on a routine basis to ensure customer connections are properly protected for years to come. The current CA in the EU-WEST-1 Region will expire on August 22, 2024. Before this date you will need to update your DB server certificate. The following is the general process to do this:\n\nFirst, update your application clients with the new certificate, if your application client is using a trust store then add the new CA certificates into the trust stores of your client applications. RDS provides download links to the CA certificates in our User Guide [2]. For more detailed instructions on updating the trust stores on your client application see our documentation [3].\n\nSecond, update the certificate on all your affected database instances to one of the newly issued CAs. \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 is the default recommended CA because there is no algorithm change. The other CAs use new key algorithms so it could require more testing of your client setup to ensure compatibility. For more information on the new CAs see our documentation [4].\n\nThird, if you want to use a different CA than the default \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019, you will need to set an account level CA override so your new instances will use the CA of your choice. To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later. For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs. \n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 certificate. If you wish for new instances to use a different certificate, you can specify which certificate to use with the AWS console or the AWS CLI. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\n3. After August 22, 2024 - \u2018rds-ca-2019\u2019 will expire.

If you believe you have already finished this work and still received this email, it is likely because you created new instances using the 2019 Certificate Authority (CA). After January 25, 2024 all newly created instances that do not explicitly specify a different CA will use the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 CA. For information on setting an account level CA override, see the modify-certificates API documentation [1].\n\nIf your applications connect to these instances using the SSL/TLS protocol, you will need to take action before August 22, 2024 to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances. Even if you do not currently use SSL for your connections, you could still be affected if your databases server certificate expires, so we still recommend updating your CA.\n\nTo protect your communications with your database instances, a CA generates time-bound certificates that are checked by your database client software to authenticate any database instance before exchanging information. Following industry best practices, AWS renews the CA and creates new certificates on a routine basis to ensure customer connections are properly protected for years to come. The current CA in the EU-WEST-1 Region will expire on August 22, 2024. Before this date you will need to update your DB server certificate. The following is the general process to do this:\n\nFirst, update your application clients with the new certificate, if your application client is using a trust store then add the new CA certificates into the trust stores of your client applications. RDS provides download links to the CA certificates in our User Guide [2]. For more detailed instructions on updating the trust stores on your client application see our documentation [3].\n\nSecond, update the certificate on all your affected database instances to one of the newly issued CAs. \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 is the default recommended CA because there is no algorithm change. The other CAs use new key algorithms so it could require more testing of your client setup to ensure compatibility. For more information on the new CAs see our documentation [4].\n\nThird, if you want to use a different CA than the default \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019, you will need to set an account level CA override so your new instances will use the CA of your choice. To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later. For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs. \n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 certificate. If you wish for new instances to use a different certificate, you can specify which certificate to use with the AWS console or the AWS CLI. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\n3. After August 22, 2024 - \u2018rds-ca-2019\u2019 will expire. You will need to take action before August 22, 2024, to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances.\n\nFor more information see our blog [9], and if you have questions or concerns, please contact AWS Support [10].\n\n[1] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/modify-certificates.html\n[2] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.CertificatesAllRegions\n[3] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation-updating\n[4] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.RegionCertificateAuthorities\n[5] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-certificates.html\n[6] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/create-db-instance.html\n[7] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[8] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[9] https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/rotate-your-ssl-tls-certificates-now-amazon-rds-and-amazon-aurora-expire-in-2024/\n[10] https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home",

If you believe you have already finished this work and still received this email, it is likely because you created new instances using the 2019 Certificate Authority (CA). After January 25, 2024 all newly created instances that do not explicitly specify a different CA will use the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 CA. For information on setting an account level CA override, see the modify-certificates API documentation [1].\n\nIf your applications connect to these instances using the SSL/TLS protocol, you will need to take action before August 22, 2024 to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances. Even if you do not currently use SSL for your connections, you could still be affected if your databases server certificate expires, so we still recommend updating your CA.\n\nTo protect your communications with your database instances, a CA generates time-bound certificates that are checked by your database client software to authenticate any database instance before exchanging information. Following industry best practices, AWS renews the CA and creates new certificates on a routine basis to ensure customer connections are properly protected for years to come. The current CA in the EU-WEST-1 Region will expire on August 22, 2024. Before this date you will need to update your DB server certificate. The following is the general process to do this:\n\nFirst, update your application clients with the new certificate, if your application client is using a trust store then add the new CA certificates into the trust stores of your client applications. RDS provides download links to the CA certificates in our User Guide [2]. For more detailed instructions on updating the trust stores on your client application see our documentation [3].\n\nSecond, update the certificate on all your affected database instances to one of the newly issued CAs. \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 is the default recommended CA because there is no algorithm change. The other CAs use new key algorithms so it could require more testing of your client setup to ensure compatibility. For more information on the new CAs see our documentation [4].\n\nThird, if you want to use a different CA than the default \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019, you will need to set an account level CA override so your new instances will use the CA of your choice. To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later. For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs. \n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 certificate.

For more details about PLEs, please consult the user guide for AWS Health Planned Lifecycle Events [1].\n\nWe are contacting you as we have identified that your AWS Account currently has one or more Amazon Linux 1 instances (AL1). A list of AL1 Amazon SageMaker Notebook Instances can be found in the 'Affected resources' tab.\n\nAs previously announced [2], AL1 has been in an extended maintenance phase and we are ending support for Amazon Linux 1 on March 31, 2024.\n\nAfter March 31, 2024, platform identifier notebook-al1-v1 will be deprecated and you will not be able to create/start Notebook Instances for AL1 platform identifier and Amazon Linux 1 AMIs will no longer receive security updates and bug fixes. If you have existing AL1 Notebook Instances on your accounts, please note that after March 31, 2024, InService Notebook Instances will not be affected and will be operational until it is stopped by using the StopNotebookInstance [3] operation by calling the SageMaker APIs, either via the UI in AWS console or programmatically through the AWS SDK. For all stopped AL1 Notebook Instances, you will be unable to restart these Notebook Instances.\n\nTo continue using your stopped Notebook Instance, you will need to migrate your workloads to an AL2 supported Notebook Instance [4].

Starting February 1, 2024 onwards, all Amazon EKS clusters running on this version will enter extended support. Kubernetes version 1.24 will stay in extended support until January 31, 2025, after which this version will no longer be supported on Amazon EKS. You will no longer be able to create new Kubernetes version 1.24 clusters after January 31, 2025, and all EKS clusters running this version will be updated to Kubernetes version 1.25 through a gradual deployment process.\n\nYou are receiving this message because you currently have 1 or more EKS clusters running with Kubernetes version 1.24, listed in the 'Affected resources' tab.\n\nExtended support is currently in preview and is available for free to all customers. When extended support is generally available in early 2024, there will be an additional per cluster per hour charge for all clusters running an extended support version. Pricing information will be announced when the feature is generally available. \n\nIf you do not want to use extended support, we recommend that you update your 1.24 clusters to Kubernetes version 1.25 or higher before the end of standard support date, January 31, 2024.

The PostgreSQL community has deprecated PostgreSQL 11 after the 11.22 release [1] and it will not receive any security patches beyond the final community release. Therefore, Amazon RDS will end standard support of PostgreSQL major version 11 on February 29, 2024.\n\nWe recommend that you take action and upgrade your PostgreSQL DBs running major version 11 to a higher major version, such as Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL 16, before end of standard support on February 29, 2024. Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL 16 includes support for logical decoding on read replicas, logical replication from standbys, and over 90 PostgreSQL extensions such as pgactive, pgvector, pg_tle, h3-pg, pg_cron, and rdkit. PostgreSQL 16 introduces a number of performance and visibility improvements including greater query parallelism, SIMD CPU acceleration, and a 'pg_stat_io' view that provides statistics on I/O usage. Further, with PostgreSQL 16, developers can now use SQL/JSON constructors and identity functions [2].\n\nIf you do not upgrade your RDS for PostgreSQL 11 databases to a higher major version by February 29, 2024, they will be automatically enrolled into Amazon RDS Extended Support [3] to optimize for availability of your database. \n\nWhat does this change mean?  \n\nYou will see three things as a result of this change:\n\n* First, we will not auto-upgrade your database(s). You will have to upgrade your database to PostgreSQL 12 or higher when you are ready. You must complete your upgrade before the end of RDS Extended Support for PostgreSQL 11 on February 28, 2027. \n* Starting on March 1, 2024, you can create new Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL 11 instances only in Amazon RDS Extended Support mode.\n* Starting on April 1, 2024, you will start to be charged [4] for Amazon RDS Extended Support on all Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL 11 database instances that are still active. The charges for Amazon RDS Extended Support service will stop when you upgrade your database instance to PostgreSQL 12 or higher. You can avoid Amazon RDS Extended Support charges entirely by upgrading to PostgreSQL 12 or higher before April 1, 2024.\n\nWhat do you need to do? \n\nYour next steps depend on whether you want to run your Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL 11 databases beyond March 31, 2024. \n\n* If you plan to run your Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL 11 database instances beyond February 29, 2024, you do not need to take any action. Your instance/cluster will be automatically enrolled into Amazon RDS Extended Support, and you will be billed for Extended Support starting April 1, 2024. Note, if you are running a minor version lower than PostgreSQL 11.22, your database will be auto-upgraded to PostgreSQL 11.22 starting on April 1, 2024. If you do not want to be auto-upgraded to PostgreSQL 11.22, we recommend that you upgrade to this version manually before March 31, 2024.\n* If you do not intend to run your Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL 11 database instances beyond March 31, 2024, or you do not want to incur expenses for Amazon RDS Extended Support, we recommend you upgrade your databases from PostgreSQL 11 to PostgreSQL 12 or higher by March 31, 2024.

Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL 16 includes support for logical decoding on read replicas, logical replication from standbys, and over 90 PostgreSQL extensions such as pgactive, pgvector, pg_tle, h3-pg, pg_cron, and rdkit. PostgreSQL 16 introduces a number of performance and visibility improvements including greater query parallelism, SIMD CPU acceleration, and a 'pg_stat_io' view that provides statistics on I/O usage.

These instances are listed in the 'Affected Resources' Tab. During this time, the instances will be stopped after 2024-03-25 12:05:00 UTC.\n\nAt any time before 2024-03-25 12:05:00 UTC, you can reschedule this maintenance or stop and start the instance through the AWS API, AWS CLI, or AWS Management Console. When rescheduling, you can pick any time up to 2024-04-08 12:05:00 UTC, at which EC2 will perform maintenance on the instance. Otherwise, you can wait for EC2 to stop your instance during the scheduled maintenance window. For more details on how to reschedule this event as well as other alternatives to complete this maintenance see the EC2 user guide https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/monitoring-instances-status-check_sched.html#reschedule-event\n\nYou can find more information about maintenance events scheduled for your EC2 instances in the AWS Management Console https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?region=us-east-1#Events\n\n* What will happen to my instance during this maintenance event?\n\nYour instance will be stopped after the specified retirement date. You can start it again at any time after it\u2019s stopped. Any data on local instance-store volumes will be lost when the instance is stopped or terminated.\n\n* What do I need to do?\n\nWe recommend that you stop and start the instance at any time before the retirement date. This will migrate the instance to a new host and the instance will not be stopped. Please note that any data on local instance-store volumes will not be preserved when you stop and start your instance. For more information about stopping and starting your instance, and what to expect when your instance is stopped, such as the effect on public, private and Elastic IP addresses associated with your instance, see Stop and Start Your Instance in the EC2 User Guide https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Stop_Start.html. \n\n* Why does my instance require maintenance?\n\nEC2 routinely performs maintenance on the underlying systems in order to strengthen the security, reliability and operational performance of the EC2 service for our customers. Additional information about maintenance events can be found at https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/monitoring-instances-status-check_sched.html#schedevents_actions_retire.\n\n\n\nIf you have any questions or concerns, you can contact the AWS Support Team on the community forums and via AWS Premium Support at: https://aws.amazon.com/support .\n",

For more details on how to reschedule this event as well as other alternatives to complete this maintenance see the EC2 user guide https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/monitoring-instances-status-check_sched.html#reschedule-event\n\nYou can find more information about maintenance events scheduled for your EC2 instances in the AWS Management Console https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?region=us-east-1#Events\n\n* What will happen to my instance during this maintenance event?\n\nYour instance will be stopped after the specified retirement date. You can start it again at any time after it\u2019s stopped. Any data on local instance-store volumes will be lost when the instance is stopped or terminated.\n\n* What do I need to do?\n\nWe recommend that you stop and start the instance at any time before the retirement date. This will migrate the instance to a new host and the instance will not be stopped. Please note that any data on local instance-store volumes will not be preserved when you stop and start your instance. For more information about stopping and starting your instance, and what to expect when your instance is stopped, such as the effect on public, private and Elastic IP addresses associated with your instance, see Stop and Start Your Instance in the EC2 User Guide https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Stop_Start.html. \n\n* Why does my instance require maintenance?\n\nEC2 routinely performs maintenance on the underlying systems in order to strengthen the security, reliability and operational performance of the EC2 service for our customers.

If you believe you have already finished this work and still received this email, it is likely because you created new instances using the 2019 Certificate Authority (CA). After January 25, 2024 all newly created instances that do not explicitly specify a different CA will use the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 CA. For information on setting an account level CA override, see the modify-certificates API documentation [1].\n\nIf your applications connect to these instances using the SSL/TLS protocol, you will need to take action before August 22, 2024 to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances. Even if you do not currently use SSL for your connections, you could still be affected if your databases server certificate expires, so we still recommend updating your CA.\n\nTo protect your communications with your database instances, a CA generates time-bound certificates that are checked by your database client software to authenticate any database instance before exchanging information. Following industry best practices, AWS renews the CA and creates new certificates on a routine basis to ensure customer connections are properly protected for years to come. The current CA in the US-EAST-1 Region will expire on August 22, 2024. Before this date you will need to update your DB server certificate. The following is the general process to do this:\n\nFirst, update your application clients with the new certificate, if your application client is using a trust store then add the new CA certificates into the trust stores of your client applications. RDS provides download links to the CA certificates in our User Guide [2]. For more detailed instructions on updating the trust stores on your client application see our documentation [3].\n\nSecond, update the certificate on all your affected database instances to one of the newly issued CAs. \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 is the default recommended CA because there is no algorithm change. The other CAs use new key algorithms so it could require more testing of your client setup to ensure compatibility. For more information on the new CAs see our documentation [4].\n\nThird, if you want to use a different CA than the default \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019, you will need to set an account level CA override so your new instances will use the CA of your choice. To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later. For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs. \n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 certificate. If you wish for new instances to use a different certificate, you can specify which certificate to use with the AWS console or the AWS CLI. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\n3. After August 22, 2024 - \u2018rds-ca-2019\u2019 will expire. You will need to take action before August 22, 2024, to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances.\n\nFor more information see our blog [9], and if you have questions or concerns, please contact AWS Support [10].\n\n[1] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/modify-certificates.html\n[2] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.CertificatesAllRegions\n[3] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation-updating\n[4] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.RegionCertificateAuthorities\n[5] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-certificates.html\n[6] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/create-db-instance.html\n[7] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[8] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[9] https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/rotate-your-ssl-tls-certificates-now-amazon-rds-and-amazon-aurora-expire-in-2024/\n[10] https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home",

If you believe you have already finished this work and still received this email, it is likely because you created new instances using the 2019 Certificate Authority (CA). After January 25, 2024 all newly created instances that do not explicitly specify a different CA will use the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 CA. For information on setting an account level CA override, see the modify-certificates API documentation [1].\n\nIf your applications connect to these instances using the SSL/TLS protocol, you will need to take action before August 22, 2024 to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances. Even if you do not currently use SSL for your connections, you could still be affected if your databases server certificate expires, so we still recommend updating your CA.\n\nTo protect your communications with your database instances, a CA generates time-bound certificates that are checked by your database client software to authenticate any database instance before exchanging information. Following industry best practices, AWS renews the CA and creates new certificates on a routine basis to ensure customer connections are properly protected for years to come. The current CA in the US-EAST-1 Region will expire on August 22, 2024. Before this date you will need to update your DB server certificate. The following is the general process to do this:\n\nFirst, update your application clients with the new certificate, if your application client is using a trust store then add the new CA certificates into the trust stores of your client applications. RDS provides download links to the CA certificates in our User Guide [2]. For more detailed instructions on updating the trust stores on your client application see our documentation [3].\n\nSecond, update the certificate on all your affected database instances to one of the newly issued CAs. \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 is the default recommended CA because there is no algorithm change. The other CAs use new key algorithms so it could require more testing of your client setup to ensure compatibility. For more information on the new CAs see our documentation [4].\n\nThird, if you want to use a different CA than the default \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019, you will need to set an account level CA override so your new instances will use the CA of your choice. To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later. For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1.

If you believe you have already finished this work and still received this email, it is likely because you created new instances using the 2019 Certificate Authority (CA). After January 25, 2024 all newly created instances that do not explicitly specify a different CA will use the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 CA. For information on setting an account level CA override, see the modify-certificates API documentation [1].\n\nIf your applications connect to these instances using the SSL/TLS protocol, you will need to take action before August 22, 2024 to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances. Even if you do not currently use SSL for your connections, you could still be affected if your databases server certificate expires, so we still recommend updating your CA.\n\nTo protect your communications with your database instances, a CA generates time-bound certificates that are checked by your database client software to authenticate any database instance before exchanging information. Following industry best practices, AWS renews the CA and creates new certificates on a routine basis to ensure customer connections are properly protected for years to come. The current CA in the US-EAST-1 Region will expire on August 22, 2024. Before this date you will need to update your DB server certificate. The following is the general process to do this:\n\nFirst, update your application clients with the new certificate, if your application client is using a trust store then add the new CA certificates into the trust stores of your client applications. RDS provides download links to the CA certificates in our User Guide [2]. For more detailed instructions on updating the trust stores on your client application see our documentation [3].\n\nSecond, update the certificate on all your affected database instances to one of the newly issued CAs. \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 is the default recommended CA because there is no algorithm change. The other CAs use new key algorithms so it could require more testing of your client setup to ensure compatibility. For more information on the new CAs see our documentation [4].\n\nThird, if you want to use a different CA than the default \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019, you will need to set an account level CA override so your new instances will use the CA of your choice. To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later. For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs. \n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 certificate. If you wish for new instances to use a different certificate, you can specify which certificate to use with the AWS console or the AWS CLI. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\n3. After August 22, 2024 - \u2018rds-ca-2019\u2019 will expire.

If you believe you have already finished this work and still received this email, it is likely because you created new instances using the 2019 Certificate Authority (CA). After January 25, 2024 all newly created instances that do not explicitly specify a different CA will use the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 CA. For information on setting an account level CA override, see the modify-certificates API documentation [1].\n\nIf your applications connect to these instances using the SSL/TLS protocol, you will need to take action before August 22, 2024 to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances. Even if you do not currently use SSL for your connections, you could still be affected if your databases server certificate expires, so we still recommend updating your CA.\n\nTo protect your communications with your database instances, a CA generates time-bound certificates that are checked by your database client software to authenticate any database instance before exchanging information. Following industry best practices, AWS renews the CA and creates new certificates on a routine basis to ensure customer connections are properly protected for years to come. The current CA in the US-EAST-1 Region will expire on August 22, 2024. Before this date you will need to update your DB server certificate. The following is the general process to do this:\n\nFirst, update your application clients with the new certificate, if your application client is using a trust store then add the new CA certificates into the trust stores of your client applications. RDS provides download links to the CA certificates in our User Guide [2]. For more detailed instructions on updating the trust stores on your client application see our documentation [3].\n\nSecond, update the certificate on all your affected database instances to one of the newly issued CAs. \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 is the default recommended CA because there is no algorithm change. The other CAs use new key algorithms so it could require more testing of your client setup to ensure compatibility. For more information on the new CAs see our documentation [4].\n\nThird, if you want to use a different CA than the default \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019, you will need to set an account level CA override so your new instances will use the CA of your choice. To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later. For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs. \n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 certificate.

To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later. For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs. \n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 certificate. If you wish for new instances to use a different certificate, you can specify which certificate to use with the AWS console or the AWS CLI. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\n3. After August 22, 2024 - \u2018rds-ca-2019\u2019 will expire. You will need to take action before August 22, 2024, to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances.\n\nFor more information see our blog [9], and if you have questions or concerns, please contact AWS Support [10].\n\n[1] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/modify-certificates.html\n[2] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.CertificatesAllRegions\n[3] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation-updating\n[4] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.RegionCertificateAuthorities\n[5] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-certificates.html\n[6] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/create-db-instance.html\n[7] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[8] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[9] https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/rotate-your-ssl-tls-certificates-now-amazon-rds-and-amazon-aurora-expire-in-2024/\n[10] https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home",

For information on setting an account level CA override, see the modify-certificates API documentation [1].\n\nIf your applications connect to these instances using the SSL/TLS protocol, you will need to take action before August 22, 2024 to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances. Even if you do not currently use SSL for your connections, you could still be affected if your databases server certificate expires, so we still recommend updating your CA.\n\nTo protect your communications with your database instances, a CA generates time-bound certificates that are checked by your database client software to authenticate any database instance before exchanging information. Following industry best practices, AWS renews the CA and creates new certificates on a routine basis to ensure customer connections are properly protected for years to come. The current CA in the US-EAST-1 Region will expire on August 22, 2024. Before this date you will need to update your DB server certificate. The following is the general process to do this:\n\nFirst, update your application clients with the new certificate, if your application client is using a trust store then add the new CA certificates into the trust stores of your client applications. RDS provides download links to the CA certificates in our User Guide [2]. For more detailed instructions on updating the trust stores on your client application see our documentation [3].\n\nSecond, update the certificate on all your affected database instances to one of the newly issued CAs. \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 is the default recommended CA because there is no algorithm change. The other CAs use new key algorithms so it could require more testing of your client setup to ensure compatibility. For more information on the new CAs see our documentation [4].\n\nThird, if you want to use a different CA than the default \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019, you will need to set an account level CA override so your new instances will use the CA of your choice. To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later. For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs. \n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 certificate. If you wish for new instances to use a different certificate, you can specify which certificate to use with the AWS console or the AWS CLI. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\n3. After August 22, 2024 - \u2018rds-ca-2019\u2019 will expire. You will need to take action before August 22, 2024, to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances.\n\nFor more information see our blog [9], and if you have questions or concerns, please contact AWS Support [10].\n\n[1] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/modify-certificates.html\n[2] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.CertificatesAllRegions\n[3] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation-updating\n[4] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.RegionCertificateAuthorities\n[5] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-certificates.html\n[6] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/create-db-instance.html\n[7] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[8] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[9] https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/rotate-your-ssl-tls-certificates-now-amazon-rds-and-amazon-aurora-expire-in-2024/\n[10] https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home",

If you believe you have already finished this work and still received this email, it is likely because you created new instances using the 2019 Certificate Authority (CA). After January 25, 2024 all newly created instances that do not explicitly specify a different CA will use the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 CA. For information on setting an account level CA override, see the modify-certificates API documentation [1].\n\nIf your applications connect to these instances using the SSL/TLS protocol, you will need to take action before August 22, 2024 to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances. Even if you do not currently use SSL for your connections, you could still be affected if your databases server certificate expires, so we still recommend updating your CA.\n\nTo protect your communications with your database instances, a CA generates time-bound certificates that are checked by your database client software to authenticate any database instance before exchanging information. Following industry best practices, AWS renews the CA and creates new certificates on a routine basis to ensure customer connections are properly protected for years to come. The current CA in the US-EAST-1 Region will expire on August 22, 2024. Before this date you will need to update your DB server certificate. The following is the general process to do this:\n\nFirst, update your application clients with the new certificate, if your application client is using a trust store then add the new CA certificates into the trust stores of your client applications. RDS provides download links to the CA certificates in our User Guide [2]. For more detailed instructions on updating the trust stores on your client application see our documentation [3].\n\nSecond, update the certificate on all your affected database instances to one of the newly issued CAs. \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 is the default recommended CA because there is no algorithm change. The other CAs use new key algorithms so it could require more testing of your client setup to ensure compatibility. For more information on the new CAs see our documentation [4].\n\nThird, if you want to use a different CA than the default \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019, you will need to set an account level CA override so your new instances will use the CA of your choice. To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later. For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs. \n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 certificate.

If you believe you have already finished this work and still received this email, it is likely because you created new instances using the 2019 Certificate Authority (CA). After January 25, 2024 all newly created instances that do not explicitly specify a different CA will use the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 CA. For information on setting an account level CA override, see the modify-certificates API documentation [1].\n\nIf your applications connect to these instances using the SSL/TLS protocol, you will need to take action before August 22, 2024 to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances. Even if you do not currently use SSL for your connections, you could still be affected if your databases server certificate expires, so we still recommend updating your CA.\n\nTo protect your communications with your database instances, a CA generates time-bound certificates that are checked by your database client software to authenticate any database instance before exchanging information. Following industry best practices, AWS renews the CA and creates new certificates on a routine basis to ensure customer connections are properly protected for years to come. The current CA in the US-EAST-1 Region will expire on August 22, 2024. Before this date you will need to update your DB server certificate. The following is the general process to do this:\n\nFirst, update your application clients with the new certificate, if your application client is using a trust store then add the new CA certificates into the trust stores of your client applications. RDS provides download links to the CA certificates in our User Guide [2]. For more detailed instructions on updating the trust stores on your client application see our documentation [3].\n\nSecond, update the certificate on all your affected database instances to one of the newly issued CAs. \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 is the default recommended CA because there is no algorithm change. The other CAs use new key algorithms so it could require more testing of your client setup to ensure compatibility. For more information on the new CAs see our documentation [4].\n\nThird, if you want to use a different CA than the default \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019, you will need to set an account level CA override so your new instances will use the CA of your choice. To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later. For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs. \n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 certificate. If you wish for new instances to use a different certificate, you can specify which certificate to use with the AWS console or the AWS CLI. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\n3. After August 22, 2024 - \u2018rds-ca-2019\u2019 will expire.

If you believe you have already finished this work and still received this email, it is likely because you created new instances using the 2019 Certificate Authority (CA). After January 25, 2024 all newly created instances that do not explicitly specify a different CA will use the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 CA. For information on setting an account level CA override, see the modify-certificates API documentation [1].\n\nIf your applications connect to these instances using the SSL/TLS protocol, you will need to take action before August 22, 2024 to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances. Even if you do not currently use SSL for your connections, you could still be affected if your databases server certificate expires, so we still recommend updating your CA.\n\nTo protect your communications with your database instances, a CA generates time-bound certificates that are checked by your database client software to authenticate any database instance before exchanging information. Following industry best practices, AWS renews the CA and creates new certificates on a routine basis to ensure customer connections are properly protected for years to come. The current CA in the US-EAST-1 Region will expire on August 22, 2024. Before this date you will need to update your DB server certificate. The following is the general process to do this:\n\nFirst, update your application clients with the new certificate, if your application client is using a trust store then add the new CA certificates into the trust stores of your client applications. RDS provides download links to the CA certificates in our User Guide [2]. For more detailed instructions on updating the trust stores on your client application see our documentation [3].\n\nSecond, update the certificate on all your affected database instances to one of the newly issued CAs. \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 is the default recommended CA because there is no algorithm change. The other CAs use new key algorithms so it could require more testing of your client setup to ensure compatibility. For more information on the new CAs see our documentation [4].\n\nThird, if you want to use a different CA than the default \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019, you will need to set an account level CA override so your new instances will use the CA of your choice. To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later. For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs. \n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 certificate.

To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later. For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs. \n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 certificate. If you wish for new instances to use a different certificate, you can specify which certificate to use with the AWS console or the AWS CLI. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\n3. After August 22, 2024 - \u2018rds-ca-2019\u2019 will expire. You will need to take action before August 22, 2024, to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances.\n\nFor more information see our blog [9], and if you have questions or concerns, please contact AWS Support [10].\n\n[1] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/modify-certificates.html\n[2] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.CertificatesAllRegions\n[3] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation-updating\n[4] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.RegionCertificateAuthorities\n[5] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-certificates.html\n[6] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/create-db-instance.html\n[7] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[8] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[9] https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/rotate-your-ssl-tls-certificates-now-amazon-rds-and-amazon-aurora-expire-in-2024/\n[10] https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home",

For information on setting an account level CA override, see the modify-certificates API documentation [1].\n\nIf your applications connect to these instances using the SSL/TLS protocol, you will need to take action before August 22, 2024 to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances. Even if you do not currently use SSL for your connections, you could still be affected if your databases server certificate expires, so we still recommend updating your CA.\n\nTo protect your communications with your database instances, a CA generates time-bound certificates that are checked by your database client software to authenticate any database instance before exchanging information. Following industry best practices, AWS renews the CA and creates new certificates on a routine basis to ensure customer connections are properly protected for years to come. The current CA in the US-EAST-1 Region will expire on August 22, 2024. Before this date you will need to update your DB server certificate. The following is the general process to do this:\n\nFirst, update your application clients with the new certificate, if your application client is using a trust store then add the new CA certificates into the trust stores of your client applications. RDS provides download links to the CA certificates in our User Guide [2]. For more detailed instructions on updating the trust stores on your client application see our documentation [3].\n\nSecond, update the certificate on all your affected database instances to one of the newly issued CAs. \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 is the default recommended CA because there is no algorithm change. The other CAs use new key algorithms so it could require more testing of your client setup to ensure compatibility. For more information on the new CAs see our documentation [4].\n\nThird, if you want to use a different CA than the default \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019, you will need to set an account level CA override so your new instances will use the CA of your choice. To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later. For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs. \n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 certificate. If you wish for new instances to use a different certificate, you can specify which certificate to use with the AWS console or the AWS CLI. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\n3. After August 22, 2024 - \u2018rds-ca-2019\u2019 will expire. You will need to take action before August 22, 2024, to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances.\n\nFor more information see our blog [9], and if you have questions or concerns, please contact AWS Support [10].\n\n[1] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/modify-certificates.html\n[2] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.CertificatesAllRegions\n[3] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation-updating\n[4] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.RegionCertificateAuthorities\n[5] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-certificates.html\n[6] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/create-db-instance.html\n[7] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[8] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[9] https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/rotate-your-ssl-tls-certificates-now-amazon-rds-and-amazon-aurora-expire-in-2024/\n[10] https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home",

If you believe you have already finished this work and still received this email, it is likely because you created new instances using the 2019 Certificate Authority (CA). After January 25, 2024 all newly created instances that do not explicitly specify a different CA will use the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 CA. For information on setting an account level CA override, see the modify-certificates API documentation [1].\n\nIf your applications connect to these instances using the SSL/TLS protocol, you will need to take action before August 22, 2024 to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances. Even if you do not currently use SSL for your connections, you could still be affected if your databases server certificate expires, so we still recommend updating your CA.\n\nTo protect your communications with your database instances, a CA generates time-bound certificates that are checked by your database client software to authenticate any database instance before exchanging information. Following industry best practices, AWS renews the CA and creates new certificates on a routine basis to ensure customer connections are properly protected for years to come. The current CA in the US-EAST-1 Region will expire on August 22, 2024. Before this date you will need to update your DB server certificate. The following is the general process to do this:\n\nFirst, update your application clients with the new certificate, if your application client is using a trust store then add the new CA certificates into the trust stores of your client applications. RDS provides download links to the CA certificates in our User Guide [2]. For more detailed instructions on updating the trust stores on your client application see our documentation [3].\n\nSecond, update the certificate on all your affected database instances to one of the newly issued CAs. \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 is the default recommended CA because there is no algorithm change. The other CAs use new key algorithms so it could require more testing of your client setup to ensure compatibility. For more information on the new CAs see our documentation [4].\n\nThird, if you want to use a different CA than the default \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019, you will need to set an account level CA override so your new instances will use the CA of your choice. To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later. For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs. \n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 certificate.

If you believe you have already finished this work and still received this email, it is likely because you created new instances using the 2019 Certificate Authority (CA). After January 25, 2024 all newly created instances that do not explicitly specify a different CA will use the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 CA. For information on setting an account level CA override, see the modify-certificates API documentation [1].\n\nIf your applications connect to these instances using the SSL/TLS protocol, you will need to take action before August 22, 2024 to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances. Even if you do not currently use SSL for your connections, you could still be affected if your databases server certificate expires, so we still recommend updating your CA.\n\nTo protect your communications with your database instances, a CA generates time-bound certificates that are checked by your database client software to authenticate any database instance before exchanging information. Following industry best practices, AWS renews the CA and creates new certificates on a routine basis to ensure customer connections are properly protected for years to come. The current CA in the US-EAST-1 Region will expire on August 22, 2024. Before this date you will need to update your DB server certificate. The following is the general process to do this:\n\nFirst, update your application clients with the new certificate, if your application client is using a trust store then add the new CA certificates into the trust stores of your client applications. RDS provides download links to the CA certificates in our User Guide [2]. For more detailed instructions on updating the trust stores on your client application see our documentation [3].\n\nSecond, update the certificate on all your affected database instances to one of the newly issued CAs. \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 is the default recommended CA because there is no algorithm change. The other CAs use new key algorithms so it could require more testing of your client setup to ensure compatibility. For more information on the new CAs see our documentation [4].\n\nThird, if you want to use a different CA than the default \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019, you will need to set an account level CA override so your new instances will use the CA of your choice. To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later. For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs. \n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 certificate. If you wish for new instances to use a different certificate, you can specify which certificate to use with the AWS console or the AWS CLI. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\n3. After August 22, 2024 - \u2018rds-ca-2019\u2019 will expire.

If you believe you have already finished this work and still received this email, it is likely because you created new instances using the 2019 Certificate Authority (CA). After January 25, 2024 all newly created instances that do not explicitly specify a different CA will use the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 CA. For information on setting an account level CA override, see the modify-certificates API documentation [1].\n\nIf your applications connect to these instances using the SSL/TLS protocol, you will need to take action before August 22, 2024 to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances. Even if you do not currently use SSL for your connections, you could still be affected if your databases server certificate expires, so we still recommend updating your CA.\n\nTo protect your communications with your database instances, a CA generates time-bound certificates that are checked by your database client software to authenticate any database instance before exchanging information. Following industry best practices, AWS renews the CA and creates new certificates on a routine basis to ensure customer connections are properly protected for years to come. The current CA in the US-EAST-1 Region will expire on August 22, 2024. Before this date you will need to update your DB server certificate. The following is the general process to do this:\n\nFirst, update your application clients with the new certificate, if your application client is using a trust store then add the new CA certificates into the trust stores of your client applications. RDS provides download links to the CA certificates in our User Guide [2]. For more detailed instructions on updating the trust stores on your client application see our documentation [3].\n\nSecond, update the certificate on all your affected database instances to one of the newly issued CAs. \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 is the default recommended CA because there is no algorithm change. The other CAs use new key algorithms so it could require more testing of your client setup to ensure compatibility. For more information on the new CAs see our documentation [4].\n\nThird, if you want to use a different CA than the default \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019, you will need to set an account level CA override so your new instances will use the CA of your choice. To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later. For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs. \n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 certificate.

To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later. For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs. \n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 certificate. If you wish for new instances to use a different certificate, you can specify which certificate to use with the AWS console or the AWS CLI. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\n3. After August 22, 2024 - \u2018rds-ca-2019\u2019 will expire. You will need to take action before August 22, 2024, to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances.\n\nFor more information see our blog [9], and if you have questions or concerns, please contact AWS Support [10].\n\n[1] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/modify-certificates.html\n[2] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.CertificatesAllRegions\n[3] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation-updating\n[4] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.RegionCertificateAuthorities\n[5] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-certificates.html\n[6] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/create-db-instance.html\n[7] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[8] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[9] https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/rotate-your-ssl-tls-certificates-now-amazon-rds-and-amazon-aurora-expire-in-2024/\n[10] https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home",

For information on setting an account level CA override, see the modify-certificates API documentation [1].\n\nIf your applications connect to these instances using the SSL/TLS protocol, you will need to take action before August 22, 2024 to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances. Even if you do not currently use SSL for your connections, you could still be affected if your databases server certificate expires, so we still recommend updating your CA.\n\nTo protect your communications with your database instances, a CA generates time-bound certificates that are checked by your database client software to authenticate any database instance before exchanging information. Following industry best practices, AWS renews the CA and creates new certificates on a routine basis to ensure customer connections are properly protected for years to come. The current CA in the US-EAST-1 Region will expire on August 22, 2024. Before this date you will need to update your DB server certificate. The following is the general process to do this:\n\nFirst, update your application clients with the new certificate, if your application client is using a trust store then add the new CA certificates into the trust stores of your client applications. RDS provides download links to the CA certificates in our User Guide [2]. For more detailed instructions on updating the trust stores on your client application see our documentation [3].\n\nSecond, update the certificate on all your affected database instances to one of the newly issued CAs. \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 is the default recommended CA because there is no algorithm change. The other CAs use new key algorithms so it could require more testing of your client setup to ensure compatibility. For more information on the new CAs see our documentation [4].\n\nThird, if you want to use a different CA than the default \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019, you will need to set an account level CA override so your new instances will use the CA of your choice. To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later. For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs. \n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 certificate. If you wish for new instances to use a different certificate, you can specify which certificate to use with the AWS console or the AWS CLI. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\n3. After August 22, 2024 - \u2018rds-ca-2019\u2019 will expire. You will need to take action before August 22, 2024, to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances.\n\nFor more information see our blog [9], and if you have questions or concerns, please contact AWS Support [10].\n\n[1] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/modify-certificates.html\n[2] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.CertificatesAllRegions\n[3] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation-updating\n[4] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.RegionCertificateAuthorities\n[5] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-certificates.html\n[6] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/create-db-instance.html\n[7] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[8] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[9] https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/rotate-your-ssl-tls-certificates-now-amazon-rds-and-amazon-aurora-expire-in-2024/\n[10] https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home",

If you believe you have already finished this work and still received this email, it is likely because you created new instances using the 2019 Certificate Authority (CA). After January 25, 2024 all newly created instances that do not explicitly specify a different CA will use the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 CA. For information on setting an account level CA override, see the modify-certificates API documentation [1].\n\nIf your applications connect to these instances using the SSL/TLS protocol, you will need to take action before August 22, 2024 to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances. Even if you do not currently use SSL for your connections, you could still be affected if your databases server certificate expires, so we still recommend updating your CA.\n\nTo protect your communications with your database instances, a CA generates time-bound certificates that are checked by your database client software to authenticate any database instance before exchanging information. Following industry best practices, AWS renews the CA and creates new certificates on a routine basis to ensure customer connections are properly protected for years to come. The current CA in the US-EAST-1 Region will expire on August 22, 2024. Before this date you will need to update your DB server certificate. The following is the general process to do this:\n\nFirst, update your application clients with the new certificate, if your application client is using a trust store then add the new CA certificates into the trust stores of your client applications. RDS provides download links to the CA certificates in our User Guide [2]. For more detailed instructions on updating the trust stores on your client application see our documentation [3].\n\nSecond, update the certificate on all your affected database instances to one of the newly issued CAs. \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 is the default recommended CA because there is no algorithm change. The other CAs use new key algorithms so it could require more testing of your client setup to ensure compatibility. For more information on the new CAs see our documentation [4].\n\nThird, if you want to use a different CA than the default \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019, you will need to set an account level CA override so your new instances will use the CA of your choice. To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later. For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs. \n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 certificate.

If you believe you have already finished this work and still received this email, it is likely because you created new instances using the 2019 Certificate Authority (CA). After January 25, 2024 all newly created instances that do not explicitly specify a different CA will use the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 CA. For information on setting an account level CA override, see the modify-certificates API documentation [1].\n\nIf your applications connect to these instances using the SSL/TLS protocol, you will need to take action before August 22, 2024 to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances. Even if you do not currently use SSL for your connections, you could still be affected if your databases server certificate expires, so we still recommend updating your CA.\n\nTo protect your communications with your database instances, a CA generates time-bound certificates that are checked by your database client software to authenticate any database instance before exchanging information. Following industry best practices, AWS renews the CA and creates new certificates on a routine basis to ensure customer connections are properly protected for years to come. The current CA in the US-EAST-1 Region will expire on August 22, 2024. Before this date you will need to update your DB server certificate. The following is the general process to do this:\n\nFirst, update your application clients with the new certificate, if your application client is using a trust store then add the new CA certificates into the trust stores of your client applications. RDS provides download links to the CA certificates in our User Guide [2]. For more detailed instructions on updating the trust stores on your client application see our documentation [3].\n\nSecond, update the certificate on all your affected database instances to one of the newly issued CAs. \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 is the default recommended CA because there is no algorithm change. The other CAs use new key algorithms so it could require more testing of your client setup to ensure compatibility. For more information on the new CAs see our documentation [4].\n\nThird, if you want to use a different CA than the default \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019, you will need to set an account level CA override so your new instances will use the CA of your choice. To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later. For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs. \n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 certificate. If you wish for new instances to use a different certificate, you can specify which certificate to use with the AWS console or the AWS CLI. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\n3. After August 22, 2024 - \u2018rds-ca-2019\u2019 will expire.

If you believe you have already finished this work and still received this email, it is likely because you created new instances using the 2019 Certificate Authority (CA). After January 25, 2024 all newly created instances that do not explicitly specify a different CA will use the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 CA. For information on setting an account level CA override, see the modify-certificates API documentation [1].\n\nIf your applications connect to these instances using the SSL/TLS protocol, you will need to take action before August 22, 2024 to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances. Even if you do not currently use SSL for your connections, you could still be affected if your databases server certificate expires, so we still recommend updating your CA.\n\nTo protect your communications with your database instances, a CA generates time-bound certificates that are checked by your database client software to authenticate any database instance before exchanging information. Following industry best practices, AWS renews the CA and creates new certificates on a routine basis to ensure customer connections are properly protected for years to come. The current CA in the US-EAST-1 Region will expire on August 22, 2024. Before this date you will need to update your DB server certificate. The following is the general process to do this:\n\nFirst, update your application clients with the new certificate, if your application client is using a trust store then add the new CA certificates into the trust stores of your client applications. RDS provides download links to the CA certificates in our User Guide [2]. For more detailed instructions on updating the trust stores on your client application see our documentation [3].\n\nSecond, update the certificate on all your affected database instances to one of the newly issued CAs. \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 is the default recommended CA because there is no algorithm change. The other CAs use new key algorithms so it could require more testing of your client setup to ensure compatibility. For more information on the new CAs see our documentation [4].\n\nThird, if you want to use a different CA than the default \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019, you will need to set an account level CA override so your new instances will use the CA of your choice. To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later. For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs. \n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 certificate.

To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later. For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs. \n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 certificate. If you wish for new instances to use a different certificate, you can specify which certificate to use with the AWS console or the AWS CLI. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\n3. After August 22, 2024 - \u2018rds-ca-2019\u2019 will expire. You will need to take action before August 22, 2024, to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances.\n\nFor more information see our blog [9], and if you have questions or concerns, please contact AWS Support [10].\n\n[1] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/modify-certificates.html\n[2] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.CertificatesAllRegions\n[3] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation-updating\n[4] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.RegionCertificateAuthorities\n[5] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-certificates.html\n[6] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/create-db-instance.html\n[7] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[8] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[9] https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/rotate-your-ssl-tls-certificates-now-amazon-rds-and-amazon-aurora-expire-in-2024/\n[10] https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home",

For information on setting an account level CA override, see the modify-certificates API documentation [1].\n\nIf your applications connect to these instances using the SSL/TLS protocol, you will need to take action before August 22, 2024 to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances. Even if you do not currently use SSL for your connections, you could still be affected if your databases server certificate expires, so we still recommend updating your CA.\n\nTo protect your communications with your database instances, a CA generates time-bound certificates that are checked by your database client software to authenticate any database instance before exchanging information. Following industry best practices, AWS renews the CA and creates new certificates on a routine basis to ensure customer connections are properly protected for years to come. The current CA in the US-EAST-1 Region will expire on August 22, 2024. Before this date you will need to update your DB server certificate. The following is the general process to do this:\n\nFirst, update your application clients with the new certificate, if your application client is using a trust store then add the new CA certificates into the trust stores of your client applications. RDS provides download links to the CA certificates in our User Guide [2]. For more detailed instructions on updating the trust stores on your client application see our documentation [3].\n\nSecond, update the certificate on all your affected database instances to one of the newly issued CAs. \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 is the default recommended CA because there is no algorithm change. The other CAs use new key algorithms so it could require more testing of your client setup to ensure compatibility. For more information on the new CAs see our documentation [4].\n\nThird, if you want to use a different CA than the default \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019, you will need to set an account level CA override so your new instances will use the CA of your choice. To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later. For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs. \n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 certificate. If you wish for new instances to use a different certificate, you can specify which certificate to use with the AWS console or the AWS CLI. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\n3. After August 22, 2024 - \u2018rds-ca-2019\u2019 will expire. You will need to take action before August 22, 2024, to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances.\n\nFor more information see our blog [9], and if you have questions or concerns, please contact AWS Support [10].\n\n[1] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/modify-certificates.html\n[2] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.CertificatesAllRegions\n[3] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation-updating\n[4] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.RegionCertificateAuthorities\n[5] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-certificates.html\n[6] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/create-db-instance.html\n[7] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[8] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[9] https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/rotate-your-ssl-tls-certificates-now-amazon-rds-and-amazon-aurora-expire-in-2024/\n[10] https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home",

If you believe you have already finished this work and still received this email, it is likely because you created new instances using the 2019 Certificate Authority (CA). After January 25, 2024 all newly created instances that do not explicitly specify a different CA will use the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 CA. For information on setting an account level CA override, see the modify-certificates API documentation [1].\n\nIf your applications connect to these instances using the SSL/TLS protocol, you will need to take action before August 22, 2024 to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances. Even if you do not currently use SSL for your connections, you could still be affected if your databases server certificate expires, so we still recommend updating your CA.\n\nTo protect your communications with your database instances, a CA generates time-bound certificates that are checked by your database client software to authenticate any database instance before exchanging information. Following industry best practices, AWS renews the CA and creates new certificates on a routine basis to ensure customer connections are properly protected for years to come. The current CA in the US-EAST-1 Region will expire on August 22, 2024. Before this date you will need to update your DB server certificate. The following is the general process to do this:\n\nFirst, update your application clients with the new certificate, if your application client is using a trust store then add the new CA certificates into the trust stores of your client applications. RDS provides download links to the CA certificates in our User Guide [2]. For more detailed instructions on updating the trust stores on your client application see our documentation [3].\n\nSecond, update the certificate on all your affected database instances to one of the newly issued CAs. \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 is the default recommended CA because there is no algorithm change. The other CAs use new key algorithms so it could require more testing of your client setup to ensure compatibility. For more information on the new CAs see our documentation [4].\n\nThird, if you want to use a different CA than the default \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019, you will need to set an account level CA override so your new instances will use the CA of your choice. To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later. For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs. \n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 certificate.

If you believe you have already finished this work and still received this email, it is likely because you created new instances using the 2019 Certificate Authority (CA). After January 25, 2024 all newly created instances that do not explicitly specify a different CA will use the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 CA. For information on setting an account level CA override, see the modify-certificates API documentation [1].\n\nIf your applications connect to these instances using the SSL/TLS protocol, you will need to take action before August 22, 2024 to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances. Even if you do not currently use SSL for your connections, you could still be affected if your databases server certificate expires, so we still recommend updating your CA.\n\nTo protect your communications with your database instances, a CA generates time-bound certificates that are checked by your database client software to authenticate any database instance before exchanging information. Following industry best practices, AWS renews the CA and creates new certificates on a routine basis to ensure customer connections are properly protected for years to come. The current CA in the US-EAST-1 Region will expire on August 22, 2024. Before this date you will need to update your DB server certificate. The following is the general process to do this:\n\nFirst, update your application clients with the new certificate, if your application client is using a trust store then add the new CA certificates into the trust stores of your client applications. RDS provides download links to the CA certificates in our User Guide [2]. For more detailed instructions on updating the trust stores on your client application see our documentation [3].\n\nSecond, update the certificate on all your affected database instances to one of the newly issued CAs. \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 is the default recommended CA because there is no algorithm change. The other CAs use new key algorithms so it could require more testing of your client setup to ensure compatibility. For more information on the new CAs see our documentation [4].\n\nThird, if you want to use a different CA than the default \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019, you will need to set an account level CA override so your new instances will use the CA of your choice. To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later. For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs. \n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 certificate.

For more information on the new CAs see our documentation [4].\n\nThird, if you want to use a different CA than the default \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019, you will need to set an account level CA override so your new instances will use the CA of your choice. To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later. For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs. \n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 certificate. If you wish for new instances to use a different certificate, you can specify which certificate to use with the AWS console or the AWS CLI. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\n3. After August 22, 2024 - \u2018rds-ca-2019\u2019 will expire. You will need to take action before August 22, 2024, to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances.\n\nFor more information see our blog [9], and if you have questions or concerns, please contact AWS Support [10].\n\n[1] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/modify-certificates.html\n[2] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.CertificatesAllRegions\n[3] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation-updating\n[4] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.RegionCertificateAuthorities\n[5] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-certificates.html\n[6] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/create-db-instance.html\n[7] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[8] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[9] https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/rotate-your-ssl-tls-certificates-now-amazon-rds-and-amazon-aurora-expire-in-2024/\n[10] https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home",

After January 25, 2024 all newly created instances that do not explicitly specify a different CA will use the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 CA. For information on setting an account level CA override, see the modify-certificates API documentation [1].\n\nIf your applications connect to these instances using the SSL/TLS protocol, you will need to take action before August 22, 2024 to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances. Even if you do not currently use SSL for your connections, you could still be affected if your databases server certificate expires, so we still recommend updating your CA.\n\nTo protect your communications with your database instances, a CA generates time-bound certificates that are checked by your database client software to authenticate any database instance before exchanging information. Following industry best practices, AWS renews the CA and creates new certificates on a routine basis to ensure customer connections are properly protected for years to come. The current CA in the US-EAST-1 Region will expire on August 22, 2024. Before this date you will need to update your DB server certificate. The following is the general process to do this:\n\nFirst, update your application clients with the new certificate, if your application client is using a trust store then add the new CA certificates into the trust stores of your client applications. RDS provides download links to the CA certificates in our User Guide [2]. For more detailed instructions on updating the trust stores on your client application see our documentation [3].\n\nSecond, update the certificate on all your affected database instances to one of the newly issued CAs. \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 is the default recommended CA because there is no algorithm change. The other CAs use new key algorithms so it could require more testing of your client setup to ensure compatibility. For more information on the new CAs see our documentation [4].\n\nThird, if you want to use a different CA than the default \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019, you will need to set an account level CA override so your new instances will use the CA of your choice. To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later. For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs. \n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 certificate. If you wish for new instances to use a different certificate, you can specify which certificate to use with the AWS console or the AWS CLI. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\n3. After August 22, 2024 - \u2018rds-ca-2019\u2019 will expire.

If you believe you have already finished this work and still received this email, it is likely because you created new instances using the 2019 Certificate Authority (CA). After January 25, 2024 all newly created instances that do not explicitly specify a different CA will use the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 CA. For information on setting an account level CA override, see the modify-certificates API documentation [1].\n\nIf your applications connect to these instances using the SSL/TLS protocol, you will need to take action before August 22, 2024 to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances. Even if you do not currently use SSL for your connections, you could still be affected if your databases server certificate expires, so we still recommend updating your CA.\n\nTo protect your communications with your database instances, a CA generates time-bound certificates that are checked by your database client software to authenticate any database instance before exchanging information. Following industry best practices, AWS renews the CA and creates new certificates on a routine basis to ensure customer connections are properly protected for years to come. The current CA in the US-EAST-1 Region will expire on August 22, 2024. Before this date you will need to update your DB server certificate. The following is the general process to do this:\n\nFirst, update your application clients with the new certificate, if your application client is using a trust store then add the new CA certificates into the trust stores of your client applications. RDS provides download links to the CA certificates in our User Guide [2]. For more detailed instructions on updating the trust stores on your client application see our documentation [3].\n\nSecond, update the certificate on all your affected database instances to one of the newly issued CAs. \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 is the default recommended CA because there is no algorithm change. The other CAs use new key algorithms so it could require more testing of your client setup to ensure compatibility. For more information on the new CAs see our documentation [4].\n\nThird, if you want to use a different CA than the default \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019, you will need to set an account level CA override so your new instances will use the CA of your choice. To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later. For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs. \n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 certificate.

For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\n3. After August 22, 2024 - \u2018rds-ca-2019\u2019 will expire.

If you believe you have already finished this work and still received this email, it is likely because you created new instances using the 2019 Certificate Authority (CA). After January 25, 2024 all newly created instances that do not explicitly specify a different CA will use the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 CA. For information on setting an account level CA override, see the modify-certificates API documentation [1].\n\nIf your applications connect to these instances using the SSL/TLS protocol, you will need to take action before August 22, 2024 to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances. Even if you do not currently use SSL for your connections, you could still be affected if your databases server certificate expires, so we still recommend updating your CA.\n\nTo protect your communications with your database instances, a CA generates time-bound certificates that are checked by your database client software to authenticate any database instance before exchanging information. Following industry best practices, AWS renews the CA and creates new certificates on a routine basis to ensure customer connections are properly protected for years to come. The current CA in the US-EAST-1 Region will expire on August 22, 2024. Before this date you will need to update your DB server certificate. The following is the general process to do this:\n\nFirst, update your application clients with the new certificate, if your application client is using a trust store then add the new CA certificates into the trust stores of your client applications. RDS provides download links to the CA certificates in our User Guide [2]. For more detailed instructions on updating the trust stores on your client application see our documentation [3].\n\nSecond, update the certificate on all your affected database instances to one of the newly issued CAs. \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 is the default recommended CA because there is no algorithm change. The other CAs use new key algorithms so it could require more testing of your client setup to ensure compatibility. For more information on the new CAs see our documentation [4].\n\nThird, if you want to use a different CA than the default \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019, you will need to set an account level CA override so your new instances will use the CA of your choice. To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later. For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs. \n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 certificate.

To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later. For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs. \n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 certificate. If you wish for new instances to use a different certificate, you can specify which certificate to use with the AWS console or the AWS CLI. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\n3. After August 22, 2024 - \u2018rds-ca-2019\u2019 will expire. You will need to take action before August 22, 2024, to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances.\n\nFor more information see our blog [9], and if you have questions or concerns, please contact AWS Support [10].\n\n[1] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/modify-certificates.html\n[2] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.CertificatesAllRegions\n[3] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation-updating\n[4] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.RegionCertificateAuthorities\n[5] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-certificates.html\n[6] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/create-db-instance.html\n[7] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[8] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[9] https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/rotate-your-ssl-tls-certificates-now-amazon-rds-and-amazon-aurora-expire-in-2024/\n[10] https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home",

Even if you do not currently use SSL for your connections, you could still be affected if your databases server certificate expires, so we still recommend updating your CA.\n\nTo protect your communications with your database instances, a CA generates time-bound certificates that are checked by your database client software to authenticate any database instance before exchanging information. Following industry best practices, AWS renews the CA and creates new certificates on a routine basis to ensure customer connections are properly protected for years to come. The current CA in the US-EAST-1 Region will expire on August 22, 2024. Before this date you will need to update your DB server certificate. The following is the general process to do this:\n\nFirst, update your application clients with the new certificate, if your application client is using a trust store then add the new CA certificates into the trust stores of your client applications. RDS provides download links to the CA certificates in our User Guide [2]. For more detailed instructions on updating the trust stores on your client application see our documentation [3].\n\nSecond, update the certificate on all your affected database instances to one of the newly issued CAs. \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 is the default recommended CA because there is no algorithm change. The other CAs use new key algorithms so it could require more testing of your client setup to ensure compatibility. For more information on the new CAs see our documentation [4].\n\nThird, if you want to use a different CA than the default \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019, you will need to set an account level CA override so your new instances will use the CA of your choice. To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later. For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs. \n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 certificate. If you wish for new instances to use a different certificate, you can specify which certificate to use with the AWS console or the AWS CLI. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\n3. After August 22, 2024 - \u2018rds-ca-2019\u2019 will expire. You will need to take action before August 22, 2024, to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances.\n\nFor more information see our blog [9], and if you have questions or concerns, please contact AWS Support [10].\n\n[1] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/modify-certificates.html\n[2] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.CertificatesAllRegions\n[3] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation-updating\n[4] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.RegionCertificateAuthorities\n[5] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-certificates.html\n[6] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/create-db-instance.html\n[7] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[8] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[9] https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/rotate-your-ssl-tls-certificates-now-amazon-rds-and-amazon-aurora-expire-in-2024/\n[10] https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home",

If you believe you have already finished this work and still received this email, it is likely because you created new instances using the 2019 Certificate Authority (CA). After January 25, 2024 all newly created instances that do not explicitly specify a different CA will use the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 CA. For information on setting an account level CA override, see the modify-certificates API documentation [1].\n\nIf your applications connect to these instances using the SSL/TLS protocol, you will need to take action before August 22, 2024 to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances. Even if you do not currently use SSL for your connections, you could still be affected if your databases server certificate expires, so we still recommend updating your CA.\n\nTo protect your communications with your database instances, a CA generates time-bound certificates that are checked by your database client software to authenticate any database instance before exchanging information. Following industry best practices, AWS renews the CA and creates new certificates on a routine basis to ensure customer connections are properly protected for years to come. The current CA in the US-EAST-1 Region will expire on August 22, 2024. Before this date you will need to update your DB server certificate. The following is the general process to do this:\n\nFirst, update your application clients with the new certificate, if your application client is using a trust store then add the new CA certificates into the trust stores of your client applications. RDS provides download links to the CA certificates in our User Guide [2]. For more detailed instructions on updating the trust stores on your client application see our documentation [3].\n\nSecond, update the certificate on all your affected database instances to one of the newly issued CAs. \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 is the default recommended CA because there is no algorithm change. The other CAs use new key algorithms so it could require more testing of your client setup to ensure compatibility. For more information on the new CAs see our documentation [4].\n\nThird, if you want to use a different CA than the default \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019, you will need to set an account level CA override so your new instances will use the CA of your choice. To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later. For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs. \n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 certificate.

If you believe you have already finished this work and still received this email, it is likely because you created new instances using the 2019 Certificate Authority (CA). After January 25, 2024 all newly created instances that do not explicitly specify a different CA will use the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 CA. For information on setting an account level CA override, see the modify-certificates API documentation [1].\n\nIf your applications connect to these instances using the SSL/TLS protocol, you will need to take action before August 22, 2024 to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances. Even if you do not currently use SSL for your connections, you could still be affected if your databases server certificate expires, so we still recommend updating your CA.\n\nTo protect your communications with your database instances, a CA generates time-bound certificates that are checked by your database client software to authenticate any database instance before exchanging information. Following industry best practices, AWS renews the CA and creates new certificates on a routine basis to ensure customer connections are properly protected for years to come. The current CA in the US-EAST-1 Region will expire on August 22, 2024. Before this date you will need to update your DB server certificate. The following is the general process to do this:\n\nFirst, update your application clients with the new certificate, if your application client is using a trust store then add the new CA certificates into the trust stores of your client applications. RDS provides download links to the CA certificates in our User Guide [2]. For more detailed instructions on updating the trust stores on your client application see our documentation [3].\n\nSecond, update the certificate on all your affected database instances to one of the newly issued CAs. \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 is the default recommended CA because there is no algorithm change. The other CAs use new key algorithms so it could require more testing of your client setup to ensure compatibility. For more information on the new CAs see our documentation [4].\n\nThird, if you want to use a different CA than the default \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019, you will need to set an account level CA override so your new instances will use the CA of your choice. To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later. For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs. \n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 certificate. If you wish for new instances to use a different certificate, you can specify which certificate to use with the AWS console or the AWS CLI. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\n3. After August 22, 2024 - \u2018rds-ca-2019\u2019 will expire.

If you believe you have already finished this work and still received this email, it is likely because you created new instances using the 2019 Certificate Authority (CA). After January 25, 2024 all newly created instances that do not explicitly specify a different CA will use the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 CA. For information on setting an account level CA override, see the modify-certificates API documentation [1].\n\nIf your applications connect to these instances using the SSL/TLS protocol, you will need to take action before August 22, 2024 to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances. Even if you do not currently use SSL for your connections, you could still be affected if your databases server certificate expires, so we still recommend updating your CA.\n\nTo protect your communications with your database instances, a CA generates time-bound certificates that are checked by your database client software to authenticate any database instance before exchanging information. Following industry best practices, AWS renews the CA and creates new certificates on a routine basis to ensure customer connections are properly protected for years to come. The current CA in the US-EAST-1 Region will expire on August 22, 2024. Before this date you will need to update your DB server certificate. The following is the general process to do this:\n\nFirst, update your application clients with the new certificate, if your application client is using a trust store then add the new CA certificates into the trust stores of your client applications. RDS provides download links to the CA certificates in our User Guide [2]. For more detailed instructions on updating the trust stores on your client application see our documentation [3].\n\nSecond, update the certificate on all your affected database instances to one of the newly issued CAs. \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 is the default recommended CA because there is no algorithm change. The other CAs use new key algorithms so it could require more testing of your client setup to ensure compatibility. For more information on the new CAs see our documentation [4].\n\nThird, if you want to use a different CA than the default \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019, you will need to set an account level CA override so your new instances will use the CA of your choice. To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later. For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs. \n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 certificate.

To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later. For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs. \n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 certificate. If you wish for new instances to use a different certificate, you can specify which certificate to use with the AWS console or the AWS CLI. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\n3. After August 22, 2024 - \u2018rds-ca-2019\u2019 will expire. You will need to take action before August 22, 2024, to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances.\n\nFor more information see our blog [9], and if you have questions or concerns, please contact AWS Support [10].\n\n[1] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/modify-certificates.html\n[2] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.CertificatesAllRegions\n[3] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation-updating\n[4] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.RegionCertificateAuthorities\n[5] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-certificates.html\n[6] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/create-db-instance.html\n[7] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[8] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[9] https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/rotate-your-ssl-tls-certificates-now-amazon-rds-and-amazon-aurora-expire-in-2024/\n[10] https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home",

Even if you do not currently use SSL for your connections, you could still be affected if your databases server certificate expires, so we still recommend updating your CA.\n\nTo protect your communications with your database instances, a CA generates time-bound certificates that are checked by your database client software to authenticate any database instance before exchanging information. Following industry best practices, AWS renews the CA and creates new certificates on a routine basis to ensure customer connections are properly protected for years to come. The current CA in the US-EAST-1 Region will expire on August 22, 2024. Before this date you will need to update your DB server certificate. The following is the general process to do this:\n\nFirst, update your application clients with the new certificate, if your application client is using a trust store then add the new CA certificates into the trust stores of your client applications. RDS provides download links to the CA certificates in our User Guide [2]. For more detailed instructions on updating the trust stores on your client application see our documentation [3].\n\nSecond, update the certificate on all your affected database instances to one of the newly issued CAs. \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 is the default recommended CA because there is no algorithm change. The other CAs use new key algorithms so it could require more testing of your client setup to ensure compatibility. For more information on the new CAs see our documentation [4].\n\nThird, if you want to use a different CA than the default \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019, you will need to set an account level CA override so your new instances will use the CA of your choice. To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later. For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs. \n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 certificate. If you wish for new instances to use a different certificate, you can specify which certificate to use with the AWS console or the AWS CLI. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\n3. After August 22, 2024 - \u2018rds-ca-2019\u2019 will expire. You will need to take action before August 22, 2024, to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances.\n\nFor more information see our blog [9], and if you have questions or concerns, please contact AWS Support [10].\n\n[1] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/modify-certificates.html\n[2] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.CertificatesAllRegions\n[3] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation-updating\n[4] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.RegionCertificateAuthorities\n[5] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-certificates.html\n[6] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/create-db-instance.html\n[7] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[8] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[9] https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/rotate-your-ssl-tls-certificates-now-amazon-rds-and-amazon-aurora-expire-in-2024/\n[10] https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home",

If you believe you have already finished this work and still received this email, it is likely because you created new instances using the 2019 Certificate Authority (CA). After January 25, 2024 all newly created instances that do not explicitly specify a different CA will use the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 CA. For information on setting an account level CA override, see the modify-certificates API documentation [1].\n\nIf your applications connect to these instances using the SSL/TLS protocol, you will need to take action before August 22, 2024 to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances. Even if you do not currently use SSL for your connections, you could still be affected if your databases server certificate expires, so we still recommend updating your CA.\n\nTo protect your communications with your database instances, a CA generates time-bound certificates that are checked by your database client software to authenticate any database instance before exchanging information. Following industry best practices, AWS renews the CA and creates new certificates on a routine basis to ensure customer connections are properly protected for years to come. The current CA in the US-EAST-1 Region will expire on August 22, 2024. Before this date you will need to update your DB server certificate. The following is the general process to do this:\n\nFirst, update your application clients with the new certificate, if your application client is using a trust store then add the new CA certificates into the trust stores of your client applications. RDS provides download links to the CA certificates in our User Guide [2]. For more detailed instructions on updating the trust stores on your client application see our documentation [3].\n\nSecond, update the certificate on all your affected database instances to one of the newly issued CAs. \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 is the default recommended CA because there is no algorithm change. The other CAs use new key algorithms so it could require more testing of your client setup to ensure compatibility. For more information on the new CAs see our documentation [4].\n\nThird, if you want to use a different CA than the default \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019, you will need to set an account level CA override so your new instances will use the CA of your choice. To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later. For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs. \n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 certificate.

If you believe you have already finished this work and still received this email, it is likely because you created new instances using the 2019 Certificate Authority (CA). After January 25, 2024 all newly created instances that do not explicitly specify a different CA will use the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 CA. For information on setting an account level CA override, see the modify-certificates API documentation [1].\n\nIf your applications connect to these instances using the SSL/TLS protocol, you will need to take action before August 22, 2024 to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances. Even if you do not currently use SSL for your connections, you could still be affected if your databases server certificate expires, so we still recommend updating your CA.\n\nTo protect your communications with your database instances, a CA generates time-bound certificates that are checked by your database client software to authenticate any database instance before exchanging information. Following industry best practices, AWS renews the CA and creates new certificates on a routine basis to ensure customer connections are properly protected for years to come. The current CA in the US-EAST-1 Region will expire on August 22, 2024. Before this date you will need to update your DB server certificate. The following is the general process to do this:\n\nFirst, update your application clients with the new certificate, if your application client is using a trust store then add the new CA certificates into the trust stores of your client applications. RDS provides download links to the CA certificates in our User Guide [2]. For more detailed instructions on updating the trust stores on your client application see our documentation [3].\n\nSecond, update the certificate on all your affected database instances to one of the newly issued CAs. \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 is the default recommended CA because there is no algorithm change. The other CAs use new key algorithms so it could require more testing of your client setup to ensure compatibility. For more information on the new CAs see our documentation [4].\n\nThird, if you want to use a different CA than the default \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019, you will need to set an account level CA override so your new instances will use the CA of your choice. To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later. For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs. \n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 certificate. If you wish for new instances to use a different certificate, you can specify which certificate to use with the AWS console or the AWS CLI. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\n3. After August 22, 2024 - \u2018rds-ca-2019\u2019 will expire.

If you believe you have already finished this work and still received this email, it is likely because you created new instances using the 2019 Certificate Authority (CA). After January 25, 2024 all newly created instances that do not explicitly specify a different CA will use the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 CA. For information on setting an account level CA override, see the modify-certificates API documentation [1].\n\nIf your applications connect to these instances using the SSL/TLS protocol, you will need to take action before August 22, 2024 to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances. Even if you do not currently use SSL for your connections, you could still be affected if your databases server certificate expires, so we still recommend updating your CA.\n\nTo protect your communications with your database instances, a CA generates time-bound certificates that are checked by your database client software to authenticate any database instance before exchanging information. Following industry best practices, AWS renews the CA and creates new certificates on a routine basis to ensure customer connections are properly protected for years to come. The current CA in the US-EAST-1 Region will expire on August 22, 2024. Before this date you will need to update your DB server certificate. The following is the general process to do this:\n\nFirst, update your application clients with the new certificate, if your application client is using a trust store then add the new CA certificates into the trust stores of your client applications. RDS provides download links to the CA certificates in our User Guide [2]. For more detailed instructions on updating the trust stores on your client application see our documentation [3].\n\nSecond, update the certificate on all your affected database instances to one of the newly issued CAs. \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 is the default recommended CA because there is no algorithm change. The other CAs use new key algorithms so it could require more testing of your client setup to ensure compatibility. For more information on the new CAs see our documentation [4].\n\nThird, if you want to use a different CA than the default \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019, you will need to set an account level CA override so your new instances will use the CA of your choice. To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later. For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs. \n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 certificate.

To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later. For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs. \n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 certificate. If you wish for new instances to use a different certificate, you can specify which certificate to use with the AWS console or the AWS CLI. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\n3. After August 22, 2024 - \u2018rds-ca-2019\u2019 will expire. You will need to take action before August 22, 2024, to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances.\n\nFor more information see our blog [9], and if you have questions or concerns, please contact AWS Support [10].\n\n[1] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/modify-certificates.html\n[2] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.CertificatesAllRegions\n[3] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation-updating\n[4] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.RegionCertificateAuthorities\n[5] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-certificates.html\n[6] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/create-db-instance.html\n[7] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[8] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[9] https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/rotate-your-ssl-tls-certificates-now-amazon-rds-and-amazon-aurora-expire-in-2024/\n[10] https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home",

Therefore, Amazon RDS will end standard support of PostgreSQL major version 11 on February 29, 2024.\n\nWe recommend that you take action and upgrade your PostgreSQL DBs running major version 11 to a higher major version, such as Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL 16, before end of standard support on February 29, 2024. Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL 16 includes support for logical decoding on read replicas, logical replication from standbys, and over 90 PostgreSQL extensions such as pgactive, pgvector, pg_tle, h3-pg, pg_cron, and rdkit. PostgreSQL 16 introduces a number of performance and visibility improvements including greater query parallelism, SIMD CPU acceleration, and a 'pg_stat_io' view that provides statistics on I/O usage. Further, with PostgreSQL 16, developers can now use SQL/JSON constructors and identity functions [2].\n\nIf you do not upgrade your RDS for PostgreSQL 11 databases to a higher major version by February 29, 2024, they will be automatically enrolled into Amazon RDS Extended Support [3] to optimize for availability of your database. \n\nWhat does this change mean?  \n\nYou will see three things as a result of this change:\n\n* First, we will not auto-upgrade your database(s).

The charges for Amazon RDS Extended Support service will stop when you upgrade your database instance to PostgreSQL 12 or higher. You can avoid Amazon RDS Extended Support charges entirely by upgrading to PostgreSQL 12 or higher before April 1, 2024.\n\nWhat do you need to do? \n\nYour next steps depend on whether you want to run your Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL 11 databases beyond March 31, 2024. \n\n* If you plan to run your Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL 11 database instances beyond February 29, 2024, you do not need to take any action.

Note, if you are running a minor version lower than PostgreSQL 11.22, your database will be auto-upgraded to PostgreSQL 11.22 starting on April 1, 2024. If you do not want to be auto-upgraded to PostgreSQL 11.22, we recommend that you upgrade to this version manually before March 31, 2024.\n* If you do not intend to run your Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL 11 database instances beyond March 31, 2024, or you do not want to incur expenses for Amazon RDS Extended Support, we recommend you upgrade your databases from PostgreSQL 11 to PostgreSQL 12 or higher by March 31, 2024.

                        "Description": "Standard support for Kubernetes version 1.24 in Amazon EKS will end on January 31, 2024. Starting February 1, 2024 onwards, all Amazon EKS clusters running on this version will enter extended support. Kubernetes version 1.24 will stay in extended support until January 31, 2025, after which this version will no longer be supported on Amazon EKS. You will no longer be able to create new Kubernetes version 1.24 clusters after January 31, 2025, and all EKS clusters running this version will be updated to Kubernetes version 1.25 through a gradual deployment process.\n\nYou are receiving this message because you currently have 1 or more EKS clusters running with Kubernetes version 1.24, listed in the 'Affected resources' tab.\n\nExtended support is currently in preview and is available for free to all customers. When extended support is generally available in early 2024, there will be an additional per cluster per hour charge for all clusters running an extended support version. Pricing information will be announced when the feature is generally available. \n\nIf you do not want to use extended support, we recommend that you update your 1.24 clusters to Kubernetes version 1.25 or higher before the end of standard support date, January 31, 2024. To learn more about extended support for Kubernetes versions, see the launch announcement [1]. For instructions on how to update your cluster(s), see the Amazon EKS service documentation [2]. \n\nTo learn more on Kubernetes version support, see the Amazon EKS service documentation [3]. \n\nIf you have questions or concerns, please contact AWS support [4].\n\n[1] https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/amazon-eks-extended-support-for-kubernetes-versions-available-in-preview/\n[2] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/update-cluster.html\n[3] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/kubernetes-versions.html\n[4] https://support.console.aws.amazon.com/support/home?#/",
